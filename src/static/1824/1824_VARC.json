She makes a convincing case that this reliance on algorithms has gone too far: Algorithms often fail to capture unquantifiable concepts such as workers\u2019 motivation and care, and discriminate against the poor and others who can\u2019t so easily game the metrics.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Basing decisions on impartial algorithms rather than subjective human appraisals would appear to prevent the incursion of favoritism, nepotism, and other biases. But as O\u2019Neil thoughtfully observes, statistical models that measure performance have biases that arise from those of their creators. As a result, algorithms are often unfair and sometimes harmful. \u201cModels are opinions embedded in mathematics,\u201d she writes.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">One example O\u2019Neil raises is the \u201cvalue-added\u201d model of teacher evaluations, used controversially in New York City schools and elsewhere, which decide whether teachers get to keep their jobs based in large part on what she calls a straightforward but poor and easily fudged proxy for their overall ability: the test scores of their students. According to data from New York City, she notes \u2026 that \u201cthe evaluation data is practically random.\u201d Meanwhile, harder-to-quantify qualities such as how well teachers engage their students or manage the classrooms go largely ignored. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">How might these flaws be addressed? O\u2019Neil\u2019s argument boils down to a belief that some of these algorithms aren\u2019t good or equitable enough \u2013 yet. Ultimately, she writes, they need to be refined with sounder statistical methods or tweaked to ensure fairness and protect people from disadvantaged backgrounds.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1824"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu7":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'>According to the passage, why was the Renaissance slow to arrive in England?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>There was a dearth of architects, craftsmen and pattern-books.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Queen Elizabeth had a worrisome association with Catholic Europe and the relative isolation of England from the European cultural mainstream impeded the free interchange of suggestions.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Rules of architecture in Elizabeth\u2019s reign were archaic and stringent and they cramped the genius of the architect masters.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>The \u2018fitness for purpose\u2019 ethos of medieval architecture continued to reign supreme in the \u201cbuilding boom\u201d of the 16<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup> century.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"2293","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"> <b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>7 <\/i><i>to <\/i><i>12<\/i><i>: <\/i>The passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.

This \u201clanguage\u201d is remarkably powerful \u2013 it can evoke strong emotions. And it is universal \u2013 the emotional content of music can be understood by anyone, regardless of cultural background. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Are the emotions evoked by a piece of music similar to, and can they influence, other emotional experiences? ... A new study provides both behavioural and physiological evidence that the emotions evoked by music can be transferred to the sense of vision, and can influence how the emotions in facial expressions are perceived. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">For their study, Nidhya Logeswaran and Joydeep Bhattacharya, of Goldsmiths College in London, performed two separate experiments. In the first, 30 participants were presented with a series of happy or sad musical excerpts, each lasting 15 seconds. After each piece of music, the participants were shown a photograph of a face, expressing either a happy, sad, or neutral expression. The photographs were flashed on a screen for 1 second, after which the participants were asked to rate the emotion on a 7-point scale, where 1 denotes extremely sad and 7 extremely happy.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Thus, the visual emotional stimuli \u2013 the photos of faces \u2013 were \u201cprimed\u201d by an emotional state conveyed by a piece of music. All the participants correctly identified the emotions expressed by the faces in the photographs presented to them. However, happy faces primed by a happy piece of music were rated as happier than when primed by sad music. Conversely, sad faces primed by a piece of sad music were rated as sadder than those primed with a happy piece of music. Finally, neutral faces were rated higher when primed by a happy piece of music and lower when primed by a sad piece. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The size of the priming effect for neutral faces was found to be almost twice that of the effect for happy and sad faces. Neutral faces contain less information than those expressing one emotion or the other, and hence are ambiguous. The brain integrates information from different senses to construct representations of the external and internal worlds; thus, in the absence of relevant visual information, it may therefore become more reliant on information from other senses when generating these representations.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The second experiment involved 15 different participants. Logeswaran and Bhattacharya used electroencephalogram (EEG) to record event-related potentials \u2013 the electrical activity in the brain associated with perception of the auditory and visual stimuli presented. A number of earlier EEG studies have shown that our emotional responses to music are associated with distinct patterns of brain activation \u2013 a happy piece of music causes an increase in activity recorded from electrodes lying over the left frontal and temporal lobes, while pieces of music which evoke negative emotions are associated with increased activity in the right frontal and temporal lobe. A similar lateralized effect has also been observed for emotionally significant visual stimuli. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The researchers compared pairs of conditions in which photographs of the same facial emotion were primed differently. In both conditions, a signal associated with the later stages of face processing, called the face-specific N170 component, was measured from electrodes overlying the occipital and parietal lobes, initially from frontal and central electrodes, followed by more activity in the electrodes located toward the back of the skull. However, a difference was observed between those in conditions in which neutral faces were primed by happy pieces of music and those in which they were primed by sad music. The former condition, but not the latter, was associated with a significant effect in frontal and central electrodes during the 50-150 millisecond time window.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">This study demonstrates that activity in one sensory system can modulate activity in another. ... It also supports the earlier finding that happy and sad emotions evoked by music produce different physiological responses in the brain, and suggests that \u201cbinding\u201d of auditory and visual emotional cues occurs at an early stage of neural processing. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1824"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu14":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'>All of the following could be observations\/ inferences of the first experiment conducted by Logeswaran and Bhattacharya as explained in the passage EXCEPT?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>A face associated with fear and anxiety was given a rating of 6 when it was primed by a piece of sad music but it was given a rating of 2 when it was primed by a piece of happy music.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Music is emotionally evocative, which is why a touch of happy music can make a picture expressing happiness seem more pleasant.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>A face expressing laughter was given a rating of 6 when it was primed by a series of happy musical excerpts but was given a rating of 5 when it was primed by a series of sad musical excerpts.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Happy music made happy faces seem even happier while sad music exaggerated the melancholy of a frown.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"a","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"2294","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"> <b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>13 <\/i><i>to <\/i><i>18<\/i><i>: <\/i>The passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.

A new study provides both behavioural and physiological evidence that the emotions evoked by music can be transferred to the sense of vision, and can influence how the emotions in facial expressions are perceived. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">For their study, Nidhya Logeswaran and Joydeep Bhattacharya, of Goldsmiths College in London, performed two separate experiments. In the first, 30 participants were presented with a series of happy or sad musical excerpts, each lasting 15 seconds. After each piece of music, the participants were shown a photograph of a face, expressing either a happy, sad, or neutral expression. The photographs were flashed on a screen for 1 second, after which the participants were asked to rate the emotion on a 7-point scale, where 1 denotes extremely sad and 7 extremely happy.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Thus, the visual emotional stimuli \u2013 the photos of faces \u2013 were \u201cprimed\u201d by an emotional state conveyed by a piece of music. All the participants correctly identified the emotions expressed by the faces in the photographs presented to them. However, happy faces primed by a happy piece of music were rated as happier than when primed by sad music. Conversely, sad faces primed by a piece of sad music were rated as sadder than those primed with a happy piece of music. Finally, neutral faces were rated higher when primed by a happy piece of music and lower when primed by a sad piece. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The size of the priming effect for neutral faces was found to be almost twice that of the effect for happy and sad faces. Neutral faces contain less information than those expressing one emotion or the other, and hence are ambiguous. The brain integrates information from different senses to construct representations of the external and internal worlds; thus, in the absence of relevant visual information, it may therefore become more reliant on information from other senses when generating these representations.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The second experiment involved 15 different participants. Logeswaran and Bhattacharya used electroencephalogram (EEG) to record event-related potentials \u2013 the electrical activity in the brain associated with perception of the auditory and visual stimuli presented. A number of earlier EEG studies have shown that our emotional responses to music are associated with distinct patterns of brain activation \u2013 a happy piece of music causes an increase in activity recorded from electrodes lying over the left frontal and temporal lobes, while pieces of music which evoke negative emotions are associated with increased activity in the right frontal and temporal lobe. A similar lateralized effect has also been observed for emotionally significant visual stimuli. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The researchers compared pairs of conditions in which photographs of the same facial emotion were primed differently. In both conditions, a signal associated with the later stages of face processing, called the face-specific N170 component, was measured from electrodes overlying the occipital and parietal lobes, initially from frontal and central electrodes, followed by more activity in the electrodes located toward the back of the skull. However, a difference was observed between those in conditions in which neutral faces were primed by happy pieces of music and those in which they were primed by sad music. The former condition, but not the latter, was associated with a significant effect in frontal and central electrodes during the 50-150 millisecond time window.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">This study demonstrates that activity in one sensory system can modulate activity in another. ...

Twilight Zone. Hoodoo Sea. Devil\"s Triangle. The Bermuda Triangle did not receive its famous nickname until 1964. The Bermuda Triangle is a mythical section of the Atlantic Ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico. Its vicinity is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas and the Caribbean islands. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">No one keeps statistics, but many ships\/ planes have vanished in the Bermuda triangle without a trace. William Shakespeare\u2019s play \u201cThe Tempest,\u201d based on a real-life Bermuda shipwreck, may have enhanced the area\u2019s aura of mystery. Christopher Columbus wrote about bizarre compass bearings in the area ... and reported that a great flame of fire crashed into the sea one night.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The legend of the Bermuda Triangle will be forever tied to Flight 19 \u2013 a training flight of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers carrying 14 men that disappeared on December 5, 1945 in the Atlantic. The squadron\"s flight plan, scheduled to take them due east from Fort Lauderdale, included a few bombing practice runs over Hen and Chickens Shoals. The crewmen of the five Avengers were inexperienced trainees, with the exception of their patrol leader, Lt. Charles Taylor. With the four rookie pilots dependent on his guidance, Taylor found that his compass malfunctioned soon into the flight. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Taylor chose to continue the run on dead reckoning, navigating by sighting landmarks below. But visibility became poor due to a brewing storm, and he quickly became disoriented. The planes flew in one direction then another as balmy daylight turned to stormy seas in the darkness. Taylor ended up thinking they were over the Gulf of Mexico, and ordered the patrol east in search of land. But in reality, they had been heading up the Atlantic coastline, and Taylor was mistakenly leading his hapless trainees much further out to sea. Radio recordings indicate that some of them suggested to Taylor that Florida was actually to the west. ... Taylor was heard formulating a plan as soon as the first plane\u2019s fuel level dipped below 10 gallons. But all five planes were to be buried in the graveyard of the Atlantic. A navy report intimated that the Avengers had disappeared \u201cas if they had flown to Mars\u201d. No known wreckage from Flight 19 has ever been recovered. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The Avenger was known as an extremely rugged plane. Pilots sometimes called them \"Iron Birds\" or Grumman ironworks. They were also very heavy, weighing more than 10,000 pounds empty.

Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\">Limbo of the Lost. Twilight Zone. Hoodoo Sea. Devil\"s Triangle. The Bermuda Triangle did not receive its famous nickname until 1964. The Bermuda Triangle is a mythical section of the Atlantic Ocean roughly bounded by Miami, Bermuda, and Puerto Rico. Its vicinity is one of the most heavily traveled shipping lanes in the world, with ships frequently crossing through it for ports in the Americas and the Caribbean islands. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">No one keeps statistics, but many ships\/ planes have vanished in the Bermuda triangle without a trace. William Shakespeare\u2019s play \u201cThe Tempest,\u201d based on a real-life Bermuda shipwreck, may have enhanced the area\u2019s aura of mystery. Christopher Columbus wrote about bizarre compass bearings in the area ... and reported that a great flame of fire crashed into the sea one night.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The legend of the Bermuda Triangle will be forever tied to Flight 19 \u2013 a training flight of five TBM Avenger torpedo bombers carrying 14 men that disappeared on December 5, 1945 in the Atlantic. The squadron\"s flight plan, scheduled to take them due east from Fort Lauderdale, included a few bombing practice runs over Hen and Chickens Shoals. The crewmen of the five Avengers were inexperienced trainees, with the exception of their patrol leader, Lt. Charles Taylor. With the four rookie pilots dependent on his guidance, Taylor found that his compass malfunctioned soon into the flight. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Taylor chose to continue the run on dead reckoning, navigating by sighting landmarks below. But visibility became poor due to a brewing storm, and he quickly became disoriented. The planes flew in one direction then another as balmy daylight turned to stormy seas in the darkness. Taylor ended up thinking they were over the Gulf of Mexico, and ordered the patrol east in search of land. But in reality, they had been heading up the Atlantic coastline, and Taylor was mistakenly leading his hapless trainees much further out to sea. Radio recordings indicate that some of them suggested to Taylor that Florida was actually to the west. ... Taylor was heard formulating a plan as soon as the first plane\u2019s fuel level dipped below 10 gallons. But all five planes were to be buried in the graveyard of the Atlantic. A navy report intimated that the Avengers had disappeared \u201cas if they had flown to Mars\u201d. No known wreckage from Flight 19 has ever been recovered. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The Avenger was known as an extremely rugged plane. Pilots sometimes called them \"Iron Birds\" or Grumman ironworks. They were also very heavy, weighing more than 10,000 pounds empty. When ditched, the Avenger would go down hard and fast. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">A rescue aircraft, a PBM Mariner with a 13-man crew, was deployed to look for Flight 19 survivors but it also disappeared. A tanker off the coast of Florida reported seeing an explosion and observing a widespread oil slick. According to <b>contemporaneous <\/b>sources, the Mariner had a history of explosions due to vapour leaks when heavily loaded with fuel and had been nicknamed the \"flying gas tank\" (The slightest spark could cause an explosion!). \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The controversial disappearance of Flight 19 and various other disappearances have been attributed to the machinations of enormous sea monsters, giant squids, extra-terrestrials, alien abductions, Atlantis, time warps, reverse gravity fields and ocean flatulence (where trapped methane was spewed by the ocean). ...\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">There are some obstacles in taking the Bermuda Triangle legend seriously. Most of the associated mishaps can be explained by rational means and many of them did not occur within the Bermuda Triangle. Sea disasters as distant as Portugal, Ireland and the Pacific and Indian Oceans have been blamed on the Bermuda Triangle. We might then just as well rename it as \u201cThe Worldwide Curse of All Seas\u201d. Some have turned this fact on its head by proposing this as evidence that the Devil\u2019s Triangle is expanding in scope. Others may respond that it is evidence that accidents will happen \u2013 no matter where exactly on the land, on the sea or in the air they take place.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1824"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu25":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>25 <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>26<\/i><i>: <\/i>The following question has a paragraph from which the last sentence has been left incomplete.
