Next, the rollers were changed into wheels by cutting out the wood in between the two grooves of the rollers and an axle-like structure was created. Special wooden pegs were used on both sides to keep the runners fastened to the axle. Thus, as the wheel turned, the axle could also turn with it.

In physics, relativity and quantum theory have utterly changed our understanding of nature. Yet these twin revolutions initiated by Einstein are mutually discordant, which tells us that they are not yet complete. Biology has also been doubly transformed by twin revolutions, each the legacy of Darwin. The most powerful has been the neo-Darwinian synthesis, which, through molecular biology, gives a detailed microscopic understanding of the processes of life. At the same time an ecological, systems-oriented perspective has developed in biology, whose vanguard has been the study of complex systems. Today, systems biology attempts, with some success, to combine the two strands.
