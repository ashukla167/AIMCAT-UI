They are now the world&#39;s biggest &quot;deep-discount&quot; grocers, offering mostly their own brands of goods and almost no premium-priced products. The Schwarz Group, which owns Lidl as well as a hypermarket brand, Kaufland, is also Europe&#39;s biggest retailer.

So all you need to do to falsify this is to find a single property that isn&rsquo;t mathematical. If I&#39;m right and this is true, then it&#39;s good news for physics, because all properties of our universe can in principle be understood if we are intelligent and creative enough.

Belief in God is central to the country&#39;s experience, yet for the broad center, faith is a matter of choice, not coercion, and the legacy of the founding is that the sensible center holds. It does so because the Founders believed themselves at work in the service of both God and man, not just one or the other. Driven by a sense of providence and an acute appreciation of the fallibility of humankind, the Founders made a nation in which faith should not be singled out for special help or particular harm.

Whatever the moniker, in most cases a select few workers are liberated from the daily grind and encouraged to invent the future. Such innovation units are becoming <i>d<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>r<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>g<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i>in the public sector too. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">These government laboratories provide a bridge between the public and private sectors. Sometimes governments simply copy what private firms are doing. MindLab is based on the Future Center, the innovation unit of Skandia, a big insurance firm. Sometimes they get money and advice from private sources. Whatever the connection, these units plug the public sector into a new world. They are full of people talking about &ldquo;disruption&rdquo; and &ldquo;iteration&rdquo;. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The units also provide a connection with academia. Britain&#39;s Behavioural Insights Team was the world&#39;s first government outfit dedicated to applying the insights of behavioural economics to public policy. Its mission was to point out the &ldquo;small details&rdquo; of policy that can have big consequences. It persuaded HM Revenue and Customs, Britain&#39;s tax collection agency, to tweak the words of a routine letter to say that most people in the recipient&#39;s local area had already paid their taxes. As a result, payment rates increased by 5 percentage points. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">A new report published by Nesta, a British charity devoted to promoting innovation, and Bloomberg Philanthropies shows how popular these government innovation labs have become. ... <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Whatever their location, the study suggests they go about things in similar ways, with a lot of emphasis on harnessing technology. The most popular idea is co-creation - getting one&#39;s customers to help invent and improve products and services. Boston&#39;s Office of New Urban Mechanics has produced a series of apps which provide citizens with a convenient way of reporting problems such as graffiti and pot holes (by taking a photograph and sending it to city hall, users provide it with evidence and GPS co-ordinates). The staff-suggestion scheme introduced by PS21 in Singapore has produced striking results: one air-force engineer came up with the idea of scanning aircraft for leaks with ultraviolet light, just as opticians scan the cornea for scratches. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Co-creation frequently goes hand in hand with open innovation and the sharing economy. Nesta and iZone offer prizes to encourage people to come up with ideas. Sitra, in Finland, and the Centre for Public Service Innovation, in South Africa, invest in health care companies. The Innovation Bureau in Seoul is extending the concept of collectively using expensive resources: &ldquo;generation sharing&rdquo; matches elderly people who have a spare room with students who need a place to stay and are willing to help out with housework. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The most striking thing about these institutions is their willingness to experiment. Policymakers usually alternate between hostility to new ideas and determination to implement a new policy without bothering to try it out first. Innovation centres tend to be both more daring and happy to test things. Sitra is experimenting with health kiosks in shopping centres which are staffed by nurses, provide routine care and stay open late and on weekends. The Centre for Social Innovation in Columbia has developed computer games which are designed to teach pre-teenagers to make sensible choices about everything from nutrition to gang membership. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It is easy to dismiss these public-sector innovators as jargon-spouting irrelevancies. America&#39;s federal government spends almost $4 trillion a year. What difference can a few reformers in mayor&#39;s offices in Boston or New Orleans make? Bureaucracies are designed to kill innovation in the name of predictability. And a change in the political wind can reverse sensible changes: New York&#39;s new mayor is undoing many of the reforms that Mr Bloomberg implemented. Politicians can also sometimes treat the existence of innovation centres as a justification for carrying on with business as usual everywhere. What is more, such centres spend a lot of time putting sticking plasters on cancers. It is admirable that France&#39;s Experimental Fund for youth provides young people with driving licenses at reduced cost. It would be better if the government changed the rules that made getting a license in France such a lengthy and expensive nightmare. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Still, something is better than nothing. And the various innovation centres have a growing number of somethings to their name. They have suggested some sensible policies: Columbia&#39;s video games have been downloaded 40000 times and Sitra&#39;s health kiosks are proving popular. They have also begun to change the institutional landscape. This year Britain&#39;s Behavioural Insights Team transformed itself into an independent social purpose company, partly owned by the British government, that sells its services to governments around the world and maintains a division in New South Wales.

The goal of teaching formal English as a second language should be to provide all citizens with the ability to read and write all those public documents by which society organises itself.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Thirdly, teachers should permit the greatest possible freedom in students\u2019 personal writing, with these understandings \u201cthat society at large will not accept ideas written in this form, that the speech and writing must be clear and comprehensible; that the student should develop his awareness of the uses of language as a result of his own writing.\u201d Students ought to be allowed to find their own voice without being buried underneath a melancholy heap of rhetorics, style-sheets, and how-to-write manifestos. \u201cI feel that if all the information is there why be concerned with general to specific and upside down triangles\u201d, writes one freshman.<b> <\/b><b>G<\/b><b>o<\/b><b>o<\/b><b>d<\/b><b> <\/b><b>q<\/b><b>u<\/b><b>e<\/b><b>s<\/b><b>t<\/b><b>i<\/b><b>o<\/b><b>n<\/b><b>,<\/b><b> <\/b><b>e<\/b><b>v<\/b><b>e<\/b><b>n<\/b><b> <\/b><b>w<\/b><b>i<\/b><b>t<\/b><b>h<\/b><b>o<\/b><b>u<\/b><b>t<\/b><b> <\/b><b>a<\/b><b> <\/b><b>q<\/b><b>u<\/b><b>e<\/b><b>s<\/b><b>t<\/b><b>i<\/b><b>o<\/b><b>n<\/b><b> <\/b><b>m<\/b><b>a<\/b><b>r<\/b><b>k<\/b><b>.<\/b>\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1805"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu35":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Which of the following will best conclude and complete the last paragraph of the passage? <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>But doing so would have been anathema to the IMF.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>And much was at stake: schools and health clinics for some of the poorest people in the world. \r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>It is hard even for a moderate-sized institution like the IMF to know a great deal about every economy in the world.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>But to the IMF the lack of detailed knowledge is of less moment, because it tends to take a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"4278","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i>5<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>4<\/i><i>0<\/i><i>:<\/i><b> <\/b>The long passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.

It is supposed to review each recipient&#39;s macro economic situation and make sure that the country is living within its means. If it is not, there is inevitably trouble down the road. In the short run, a country can live beyond its means by borrowing but eventually a day of reckoning comes, and there is a crisis. The IMF is particularly concerned about inflation. Countries whose governments spend more than they take in taxes and foreign aid often will face inflation, especially if they finance their deficits by printing money. Of course, there are other dimensions to good macro-economic policy besides inflation. The term macro refers to the aggregate behaviour, the overall levels of growth, employment, and inflation, and a country can have low inflation but no growth and high unemployment. To most economists, such a country would rate as having a disastrous macro-economic framework. To most economists, inflation is not so much an end in itself, but a means to an end: it is because excessively high inflation often leads to low growth, and low growth leads to high unemployment, that inflation is so frowned upon. But the IMF often seems to confuse means with ends, thereby losing sight of what is ultimately of concern. A country like Argentina can get an &ldquo;A&rdquo; grade even if it has double-digit unemployment for years, so long as its budget seems in balance and its inflation seems in control! <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">If a country does not come up to certain minimum standards, the IMF suspends assistance; and typically, when it does, so do other donors. But if the macro-economic indicators - inflation and growth - are solid, as they were in Ethiopia, surely the underlying macro-economic framework must be good. The World Bank also had direct evidence of the competence of the Ethiopian government and its commitment to the poor. Ethiopia had formulated a rural development strategy, focussing its attention on the poor, and especially the 85 percent of the population living in the rural sector. It had dramatically cut back on military expenditures - remarkable for a government which had come to power through military means - because it knew that funds spent on weapons were funds that could not be spent on fighting poverty. Surely, this was precisely the kind of government to which the international community should have been giving assistance? But the IMF had suspended its program with Ethiopia, in spite of the good macro-economic performance, saying it was worried about Ethiopia&#39;s budgetary position. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The Ethiopian government had two revenue sources - taxes and foreign assistance. A government&#39;s budget is in balance so long as its revenue sources equal its expenditures. Ethiopia, like many developing countries, derived much of its revenue from foreign assistance. The IMF worried that if this aid dried up, Ethiopia&#39;s budgetary position could be judged solid only if expenditures were limited to the taxes it collected. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The obvious problem with the IMF&#39;s logic is that it implies no poor country can ever spend money on anything it gets aid for. If Sweden, say, gives money to Ethiopia to build schools, this logic dictates that Ethiopia should instead put the money into its reserves. But this is not why international donors give aid. In Ethiopia, the donors who were working independently and not beholden to the IMF, wanted to see new schools and health clinics built, and so did Ethiopia. &hellip; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The IMF view was not rooted in a long-held concern about project sustainability. Sometimes countries had used aid dollars to construct schools or clinics. When the aid money ran out, there was no money to maintain these facilities. The donors had recognized this problem and built it into their assistance programs in Ethiopia and elsewhere. But what the IMF alleged in the case of Ethiopia went beyond that concern. The Fund contended that international assistance was too unstable to be relied upon. The IMF&#39;s position made no sense, and not just because of its absurd implications. Assistance was often far more stable than tax revenues, which can vary markedly with economic conditions. Statistics, when checked, confirmed that international assistance was more stable than tax revenues. Using the IMF reasoning about stable sources of revenue, Ethiopia, and other developing countries, should have counted foreign aid but not included tax revenues in their budgets. And if neither taxes nor foreign assistance were to be included in the revenue side of budgets, every country would be considered to be in bad shape. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But the IMF&#39;s reasoning was even more flawed. There are a number of appropriate responses to instability of revenues, such as setting aside additional reserves and maintaining flexibility of expenditures. If revenues, from any source, decline, and there are not reserves to be drawn upon, then the government has to be prepared to cut back expenditures. But for the kinds of assistance that constitute so much of what a poor country like Ethiopia receives, there is a built-in flexibility; if the country does not receive money to build an additional school, it simply does not build the school. Ethiopia&#39;s government officials understood what was at issue, they understood the concern about what might happen if either tax revenues or foreign assistance should fall, and they had designed policies to deal with these contingencies. What couldn&#39;t be understood is why the IMF couldn&#39;t see the logic of their position? __________________________________________________________ <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1805-2"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu36":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">According to the writer, proof that Ethiopia&#39;s macro-economic framework was worthy of support lies in the fact that <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>it had a competent government that sought donor assistance.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>its micro-economic condition foreshadowed better macro-economic future.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>its government preferred developmental activities to building up military might.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>it was a recipient of aid from European countries.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","CORRECT_ANSWER":"c","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"4278","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i>5<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>4<\/i><i>0<\/i><i>:<\/i><b> <\/b>The long passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.

It is supposed to review each recipient&#39;s macro economic situation and make sure that the country is living within its means. If it is not, there is inevitably trouble down the road. In the short run, a country can live beyond its means by borrowing but eventually a day of reckoning comes, and there is a crisis. The IMF is particularly concerned about inflation. Countries whose governments spend more than they take in taxes and foreign aid often will face inflation, especially if they finance their deficits by printing money. Of course, there are other dimensions to good macro-economic policy besides inflation. The term macro refers to the aggregate behaviour, the overall levels of growth, employment, and inflation, and a country can have low inflation but no growth and high unemployment. To most economists, such a country would rate as having a disastrous macro-economic framework. To most economists, inflation is not so much an end in itself, but a means to an end: it is because excessively high inflation often leads to low growth, and low growth leads to high unemployment, that inflation is so frowned upon. But the IMF often seems to confuse means with ends, thereby losing sight of what is ultimately of concern. A country like Argentina can get an &ldquo;A&rdquo; grade even if it has double-digit unemployment for years, so long as its budget seems in balance and its inflation seems in control! <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">If a country does not come up to certain minimum standards, the IMF suspends assistance; and typically, when it does, so do other donors. But if the macro-economic indicators - inflation and growth - are solid, as they were in Ethiopia, surely the underlying macro-economic framework must be good. The World Bank also had direct evidence of the competence of the Ethiopian government and its commitment to the poor. Ethiopia had formulated a rural development strategy, focussing its attention on the poor, and especially the 85 percent of the population living in the rural sector. It had dramatically cut back on military expenditures - remarkable for a government which had come to power through military means - because it knew that funds spent on weapons were funds that could not be spent on fighting poverty. Surely, this was precisely the kind of government to which the international community should have been giving assistance? But the IMF had suspended its program with Ethiopia, in spite of the good macro-economic performance, saying it was worried about Ethiopia&#39;s budgetary position. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The Ethiopian government had two revenue sources - taxes and foreign assistance. A government&#39;s budget is in balance so long as its revenue sources equal its expenditures. Ethiopia, like many developing countries, derived much of its revenue from foreign assistance. The IMF worried that if this aid dried up, Ethiopia&#39;s budgetary position could be judged solid only if expenditures were limited to the taxes it collected. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The obvious problem with the IMF&#39;s logic is that it implies no poor country can ever spend money on anything it gets aid for. If Sweden, say, gives money to Ethiopia to build schools, this logic dictates that Ethiopia should instead put the money into its reserves. But this is not why international donors give aid. In Ethiopia, the donors who were working independently and not beholden to the IMF, wanted to see new schools and health clinics built, and so did Ethiopia. &hellip; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The IMF view was not rooted in a long-held concern about project sustainability. Sometimes countries had used aid dollars to construct schools or clinics. When the aid money ran out, there was no money to maintain these facilities. The donors had recognized this problem and built it into their assistance programs in Ethiopia and elsewhere. But what the IMF alleged in the case of Ethiopia went beyond that concern. The Fund contended that international assistance was too unstable to be relied upon. The IMF&#39;s position made no sense, and not just because of its absurd implications. Assistance was often far more stable than tax revenues, which can vary markedly with economic conditions. Statistics, when checked, confirmed that international assistance was more stable than tax revenues. Using the IMF reasoning about stable sources of revenue, Ethiopia, and other developing countries, should have counted foreign aid but not included tax revenues in their budgets. And if neither taxes nor foreign assistance were to be included in the revenue side of budgets, every country would be considered to be in bad shape. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But the IMF&#39;s reasoning was even more flawed. There are a number of appropriate responses to instability of revenues, such as setting aside additional reserves and maintaining flexibility of expenditures.

But for the kinds of assistance that constitute so much of what a poor country like Ethiopia receives, there is a built-in flexibility; if the country does not receive money to build an additional school, it simply does not build the school.
