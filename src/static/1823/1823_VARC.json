Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\">As organ transplantation becomes increasingly successful, surgeons are facing a new series of thorny practical and ethical issues.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The fundamental problem is that there are far more potential patients than donors. At least 17,000 Americans are now waiting for an organ.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">As a practical matter, doctors are trying innovation and improvisation to expand the pool of donors. For instance, they are moving to relax age restrictions on donations. They have even used organs from 70-year-old adults in children.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">On the ethical issues, however, doctors are finding that improvised solutions are either inappropriate or impossible. With the number of multiple-organ transplants growing, for example, society must decide whether limits should be set on the number of organs one person receives.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In reconsidering the age restriction on donations, doctors are charting new biological territory. Physicians have been reluctant to transplant older organs that might be damaged or might not function long. But the existing standards reflect arbitrary limits. For kidneys it is about 60 years, while for livers it is 55. For hearts, it is 45 for women and 40 for men. The age differences generally reflect the relative incidence of organ damage from clogged arteries.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">\"\"The chronological cutoff doesn\"t make a lot of sense because someone who dies at 75 can be biologically younger than someone at 50,\"\" said Dr. Calvin R. Stiller, the head of transplant surgery at the University of Western Ontario in London and a leader in transplantation.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In June, Dr. William J. Wall from the Western Ontario team took the liver from a 70-year-old man and gave it to a 10-year-old boy. The liver has functioned well for six months. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The crucial factor in using an older organ is the condition of the blood vessels. \"\"If they are open or easily reparable, we use the organ,\"\" Dr. Stiller said.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In one unusual case, a Western Ontario transplant team headed by Dr. Neil McKenzie removed a heart from a 58-year-old man who died of a stroke. Finding the arteries blocked by fatty deposits, the surgeons performed a bypass operation on the heart and then transplanted it into a patient dying of heart disease.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The Western Ontario team has performed 16 other heart transplants with organs donated by individuals aged 46 to 58.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Doctors at Western Ontario are also testing the use of human hearts as bridges to keep patients alive while they seek a better match or stronger heart. This runs parallel to the efforts in many medical centers to use artificial hearts as bridges.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Dr. Stiller\"s team has used human hearts as bridges in five cases. The hypothesis is that a human organ involves less risk and cost, even if it does not achieve peak performance. The surgeons also knew that if the heart failed, they could remove it and implant an artificial heart.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In three of the five cases, the temporary human heart transplant did the job until a better heart was found after about a week. In the other two cases, the \"\"temporary\"\" heart has become a permanent, well-functioning transplant. Both patients are still alive; one has survived for 17 months with the heart. Doctors are also turning to living donors for organs that they had not expected to be able to use. In the past, doctors were limited to removing one of two kidneys from a living donor, or taking a portion of the pancreas, which lies deep in the abdomen.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But in recent months, doctors in four countries have taken a portion, or lobe, of the liver from a parent and have given it to a child with fatal liver disease. Two such transplants were done at the University of Chicago in recent weeks.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Members of the transplant team are optimistic that by using a living family member for the donation, they will not have to wait as long to find a good match with a cadaver liver. As a result, the tiny patients may be healthier when they receive the transplants.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In the first procedure in Chicago, both the recipient and the donor suffered complications. The infant has had three additional operations to stop bleeding after the transplant. And the infant\"s mother had to have her spleen removed because doctors accidentally nicked it during the operation on her liver.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The potential for such complications have made many people uneasy about using the liver or pancreas because there are no backups.

In the other two cases, the \"\"temporary\"\" heart has become a permanent, well-functioning transplant. Both patients are still alive; one has survived for 17 months with the heart. Doctors are also turning to living donors for organs that they had not expected to be able to use. In the past, doctors were limited to removing one of two kidneys from a living donor, or taking a portion of the pancreas, which lies deep in the abdomen.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But in recent months, doctors in four countries have taken a portion, or lobe, of the liver from a parent and have given it to a child with fatal liver disease.

At least 17,000 Americans are now waiting for an organ.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">As a practical matter, doctors are trying innovation and improvisation to expand the pool of donors. For instance, they are moving to relax age restrictions on donations. They have even used organs from 70-year-old adults in children.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">On the ethical issues, however, doctors are finding that improvised solutions are either inappropriate or impossible. With the number of multiple-organ transplants growing, for example, society must decide whether limits should be set on the number of organs one person receives.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In reconsidering the age restriction on donations, doctors are charting new biological territory. Physicians have been reluctant to transplant older organs that might be damaged or might not function long. But the existing standards reflect arbitrary limits. For kidneys it is about 60 years, while for livers it is 55. For hearts, it is 45 for women and 40 for men. The age differences generally reflect the relative incidence of organ damage from clogged arteries.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">\"\"The chronological cutoff doesn\"t make a lot of sense because someone who dies at 75 can be biologically younger than someone at 50,\"\" said Dr. Calvin R.

This recently charted path may open possibilities of the discoveries of new and interesting histories in the human race. Whereas conventional archaeology practices can draw the objects, buildings, and even people forth, psychic archaeology can bring life and a sense of being to these discoveries and how they matter in ancient people\u2019s lives. From these re-routed stories we can learn more about our species\u2019 past, and in turn learn more about ourselves. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">There are several different methods psychic archaeologists use to uncover the mysteries of the past. Dowsing, the ancient practice of discovering \u2018earthed\u2019 things such as water and metal, has been recorded as being practiced as early as the 15th century. It is utilized by intuitive diggers to find electromagnetic photo-fields, which are said to radiate from man-made objects of six months or older. This is done using either metal rods, or various types of branches. The dowsing rod or branch moves in accordance with the desired object, leading the treasure hunter to the desired object. This practice was used even in the military in attempts to find underground explosive devices. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Psychic George McMullen, however, used the ability of psychometry, which is the knack of sensing the history of an object by holding it. By holding an object he could sense the owner, when, where, and how it was made, and whether or not the owner had passed away. Not only could he identify the history of an object, but he could also sense the culture aspects surrounding the object and its owners. Simply by standing over an unexcavated site, he knew the time period, race, and sociological aspects of the oldest remains that lay beneath him. One can see how skills like this could be extremely helpful on a site, as knowing what you are digging for and how to get to it is a rarity in the craft.

The merge of science and intuition may seem unlikely to some, but it has proved to be effective in aiding the uncovering of ancient societies and their secrets. Many skeptics have been turned into believers after the psychic information given aligned with the cold, hard, scientific facts, and even took them a step further, mapping out knowledge that would not have been known earlier.

This recently charted path may open possibilities of the discoveries of new and interesting histories in the human race. Whereas conventional archaeology practices can draw the objects, buildings, and even people forth, psychic archaeology can bring life and a sense of being to these discoveries and how they matter in ancient people\u2019s lives. From these re-routed stories we can learn more about our species\u2019 past, and in turn learn more about ourselves. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">There are several different methods psychic archaeologists use to uncover the mysteries of the past. Dowsing, the ancient practice of discovering \u2018earthed\u2019 things such as water and metal, has been recorded as being practiced as early as the 15th century. It is utilized by intuitive diggers to find electromagnetic photo-fields, which are said to radiate from man-made objects of six months or older. This is done using either metal rods, or various types of branches. The dowsing rod or branch moves in accordance with the desired object, leading the treasure hunter to the desired object. This practice was used even in the military in attempts to find underground explosive devices. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Psychic George McMullen, however, used the ability of psychometry, which is the knack of sensing the history of an object by holding it. By holding an object he could sense the owner, when, where, and how it was made, and whether or not the owner had passed away. Not only could he identify the history of an object, but he could also sense the culture aspects surrounding the object and its owners. Simply by standing over an unexcavated site, he knew the time period, race, and sociological aspects of the oldest remains that lay beneath him. One can see how skills like this could be extremely helpful on a site, as knowing what you are digging for and how to get to it is a rarity in the craft. Other psychics used different tools, such as remote viewing, precognitive dreaming, and channeling. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Within the past century, many have been fighting to have psychic archaeology appreciated as a resourceful practice in the field. The merge of science and intuition may seem unlikely to some, but it has proved to be effective in aiding the uncovering of ancient societies and their secrets. Many skeptics have been turned into believers after the psychic information given aligned with the cold, hard, scientific facts, and even took them a step further, mapping out knowledge that would not have been known earlier.

Considering that the company she runs makes its money selling bottled water, her enthusiasm might have seemed a little strange. Ms. Jeon held up one of her company\u2019s bright blue opaque bottles, which are made mostly of paper, not plastic. \u201cI would never advocate drinking this over tap,\u201d Ms. Jeon said. But the reality is that more consumers are moving to bottled water as they cut down on drinking sugary beverages. Her company has positioned its bottled water, called Just Water, as the next best thing to tap. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Most tap water in the United States is safe to drink, according to environmental groups. But many consumers prefer the convenience of bottled water, and are willing to pay for it. As Ms. Jeon sees it, she is making the best of a bad situation. Her product is less harmful to the environment and creates fewer carbon emissions than energy-intensive plastic. In the process, she is also helping the struggling city of Glens Falls, N.Y. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">When Just Water first asked the mayor, Jack Diamond, about sourcing and bottling water in his city, he initially thought the offer was too good to be true. When he has been approached by companies in the past, in general, \u201cit\u2019s not so much what they\u2019re going to do for us, but what can we do for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThe roles were reversed with this company.\u201d\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Just Water might be a boon to Glens Falls, but if environmental groups like Ban the Bottle had their way, people would take reusable water bottles with them everywhere, and bottled water would be unnecessary in most situations. That fight, however, has remained a losing battle. In 2014, annual bottled water consumption in the United States reached a peak of 34 gallons a person. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The reason for bottled water \u201chas nothing to do with the availability of good, clean appealing water in the country. It has to do with how we live,\u201d Mr. Fishman said. \u201cIt has to do with the disappearance of good water fountains \u2013 with the failure of water fountain companies to innovate cool, interesting, appealing water fountains.\u201d\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Ms. Jeon said she thought she had left the bottled water industry for good when Drew Fitzgerald, the founder of Just Water, approached her with his idea to make everyday packaged items more environmentally friendly, starting with bottled water. He was an adviser to Prime, an organization that helps foundations and wealthy families finance technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

These include the environmental costs of shipping water, the effects of removing water from communities and water bottle waste.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Of course, water bottles can be recycled. \u201cAll bottled water containers are 100 percent recyclable and many bottled water companies are already using recycled plastic in their bottles,\u201d said Chris Hogan, a spokesman for the International Bottled Water Association. \u201cAs an industry, we are always looking for ways to strengthen existing programs and help to expand recycling efforts ever further,\u201d he wrote.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Just Water isn\u2019t the only company offering an alternative to traditional bottled water.

Specifically this concerns mutations that become neutral substitutions, or lasting changes to letters of the genetic code that do not affect an organism\u2019s chances of surviving and reproducing.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">If such mutations arise clocklike, then calculating the time since two organisms shared common ancestors should be as easy as dividing the number of genetic differences between them by the mutation rate. But you need to know the rate. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">For decades, anthropologists used fossil calibration to generate the so-called phylogenetic rate (a phylogeny is a tree showing evolutionary relationships). They took the geologic age of fossils from evolutionary branch points and calculated how fast mutations must have arisen along the resulting lineages.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">For example, the earliest fossils on the human branch after our split with chimps are identified by the fact that they seem to have walked on two legs; bipedalism is the first obvious difference that distinguishes our evolutionary lineage of hominins from that of chimps. These fossils are 7-6 million years old, and therefore the chimp-human split should be around that age. Dividing the number of genetic differences between living chimps and humans by 6.5 million years provides a mutation rate. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But genetic dating got messy in 2010, when improvements to DNA sequencing allowed researchers to determine the number of genetic differences between parents and their children. Known as pedigree analysis, this provides a more direct measurement of the current mutation rate within one generation, rather than an average over millions of years. Pedigree analysis counts 60-some mutations every generation; that converts to a rate approximately half the phylogenetic estimate \u2013 meaning evolutionary events would be twice as old. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">It turns out that among primates, the molecular clock varies significantly by species, sex, and mutation type.  A recent study found that New World monkeys (i.e. monkeys of the Americas like marmosets and squirrel monkeys) have substitution rates about 64% higher than apes (including humans). Within apes, rates are about 7% higher in gorillas and 2% higher in chimpanzees, compared to humans. \u2026 It\u2019s now clear that one mutation rate cannot determine the dates for all divergences relevant to human evolution. However, researchers can secure the timeline for important evolutionary events by combining new methods of genetic dating with fossils and geologic ages. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Innovative computational methods have incorporated reproductive variables into calculations. By taking into account ages of reproduction in both sexes, age of male puberty, and sperm production rates, researchers have estimated split times that accord with the fossil record.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Another new approach has analysed mutations that are mainly independent of DNA replication. It seems that certain classes of mutations, related to DNA damage, do behave more clocklike.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">And some researchers have focused on ancient DNA. Comparing human fossils from the past 50,000 years to humans today, suggests a mutation rate that agrees with pedigree analysis.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">At least one evolutionary split was pinned down in 2016, after ancient DNA was extracted from 430,000 year-old hominin fossils from Sima de los Huesos, Spain. The Sima hominins looked like early members of the Neanderthal lineage based on morphological similarities. This hypothesis fit the timing of the split between Neanderthals and modern humans based on pedigree analysis (765,000-550,000 years ago), but did not work with the phylogenetic estimate (383,000-275,000 years ago).\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Where do the Sima hominins belong on our family tree? Were they ancestors of both Neanderthals and modern humans, just Neanderthals, or neither? \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">DNA answered this definitively. The Sima hominins belong to the Neanderthal branch after it split with modern humans. Moreover, the result provides a firm time point in our family tree, suggesting that the pedigree rate works for this period of human evolution.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Neanderthals and modern humans likely diverged between 765,000-550,000 years ago. Other evolutionary splits may soon be clarified as well, thanks to advances brought about by the mutation rate debates.

They took the geologic age of fossils from evolutionary branch points and calculated how fast mutations must have arisen along the resulting lineages.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">For example, the earliest fossils on the human branch after our split with chimps are identified by the fact that they seem to have walked on two legs; bipedalism is the first obvious difference that distinguishes our evolutionary lineage of hominins from that of chimps. These fossils are 7-6 million years old, and therefore the chimp-human split should be around that age. Dividing the number of genetic differences between living chimps and humans by 6.5 million years provides a mutation rate. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But genetic dating got messy in 2010, when improvements to DNA sequencing allowed researchers to determine the number of genetic differences between parents and their children. Known as pedigree analysis, this provides a more direct measurement of the current mutation rate within one generation, rather than an average over millions of years. Pedigree analysis counts 60-some mutations every generation; that converts to a rate approximately half the phylogenetic estimate \u2013 meaning evolutionary events would be twice as old. \u2026\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">It turns out that among primates, the molecular clock varies significantly by species, sex, and mutation type.  A recent study found that New World monkeys (i.e. monkeys of the Americas like marmosets and squirrel monkeys) have substitution rates about 64% higher than apes (including humans). Within apes, rates are about 7% higher in gorillas and 2% higher in chimpanzees, compared to humans. \u2026 It\u2019s now clear that one mutation rate cannot determine the dates for all divergences relevant to human evolution. However, researchers can secure the timeline for important evolutionary events by combining new methods of genetic dating with fossils and geologic ages. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Innovative computational methods have incorporated reproductive variables into calculations. By taking into account ages of reproduction in both sexes, age of male puberty, and sperm production rates, researchers have estimated split times that accord with the fossil record.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Another new approach has analysed mutations that are mainly independent of DNA replication. It seems that certain classes of mutations, related to DNA damage, do behave more clocklike.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">And some researchers have focused on ancient DNA. Comparing human fossils from the past 50,000 years to humans today, suggests a mutation rate that agrees with pedigree analysis.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">At least one evolutionary split was pinned down in 2016, after ancient DNA was extracted from 430,000 year-old hominin fossils from Sima de los Huesos, Spain. The Sima hominins looked like early members of the Neanderthal lineage based on morphological similarities. This hypothesis fit the timing of the split between Neanderthals and modern humans based on pedigree analysis (765,000-550,000 years ago), but did not work with the phylogenetic estimate (383,000-275,000 years ago).\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Where do the Sima hominins belong on our family tree? Were they ancestors of both Neanderthals and modern humans, just Neanderthals, or neither? \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">DNA answered this definitively. The Sima hominins belong to the Neanderthal branch after it split with modern humans. Moreover, the result provides a firm time point in our family tree, suggesting that the pedigree rate works for this period of human evolution.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Neanderthals and modern humans likely diverged between 765,000-550,000 years ago. Other evolutionary splits may soon be clarified as well, thanks to advances brought about by the mutation rate debates. Someday soon, when you see a chimp, you may be able to salute your great, great\u2026 great grandparent, with the correct number of \u201cgreats.\u201d \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1823"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu25":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>25 <\/i><i>to <\/i><i>27<\/i><i>: <\/i>Five sentences related to a topic are given below.
