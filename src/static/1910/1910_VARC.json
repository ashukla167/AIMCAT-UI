Consider the alliances formed by Samsung and Sony with suppliers, sales channels, and R&amp;D partners from 2008 to 2011. Samsung is at the centre of its network &ndash; a vantage point from which it can combine insights from such diverse partners as DreamWorks and KT, which do interesting things with 3D technologies but don&rsquo;t typically work together. Like Apple, which invented the iPhone after gleaning insights from Motorola and disparate other partners, Samsung is well placed to look to the future and conceive a breakthrough product &ndash; perhaps the first handheld device for watching 3D movies without special glasses. (Its Galaxy S4 has cutting-edge gesture and eye-tracking features.) But, it risks the isolation experienced by another hub firm, Boeing, whose network did not foster the deeply integrated partnerships needed to tackle manufacturing problems on its innovative 787 Dreamliner and to avoid product launch delays. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Sony is part of a web of allies, including Sharp and Toshiba, that work with one another.

But this was a banner year for cryo\u2013electron microscopy (cryo-EM), a technique that allows scientists to create freeze-frame images of complex molecules as they interact with each other. This year, cryo-EM delivered multiple insights into the way key protein complexes work; the U.S. National Institutes of Health set up a network of cryo-EM centers around the country, and some of the pioneers of the technique were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Cryo-EM uses liquid ethane to flash freeze molecules in midmovement in water. Researchers then view them under an electron microscope and employ computer programs to sort the images and assemble the data into a coherent structure. Unlike x-ray crystallography \u2013 the gold standard of structural biology \u2013 cryo-EM doesn\u2019t require target molecules to be crystallized, often a difficult task, and because it catches them midstride, it can reveal clues to function. The technique\u2019s roots go back decades, but improvements in instrumentation, software to speed up image processing and analysis, and new quality standards in the works to reduce errors have helped touch off an explosion of advances.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">By delivering near\u2013atomic-resolution to structures never seen before, cryo-EM is helping explain decades of biochemical and genetic observations. This year, it gave researchers new looks at how spliceosomes \u2013 key machines for processing RNA \u2013 function, a clearer view of the proteins that remodel membranes during the life of a cell, and insights into the enzymes that fix breaks in DNA. The technology also produced high-resolution models of the tangles and plaque-forming fibrils that accumulate in the brains of Alzheimer\u2019s patients, and showed how the gene-editing complex CRISPR captures and manipulates DNA. And researchers pushed cryo-EM\u2019s ability to tackle large and small molecules, solving the structures of a red alga\u2019s gigantic light-harvesting complex and several small protein complexes that were previously out of its reach.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1910"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu10":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Which of the following best defines the basic premise about a good design for a city according to the author?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>It should offer universal accessibility.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>It should keep both the male and female genders in mind.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>It should keep up with the trends of the contemporary times.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>It should create the right conditions for men and women to shape society.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"a","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"6197","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><i><b> <\/b><\/i><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>0<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>5<\/i><i>:<\/i><i> <\/i>The passage given below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

Argle is a materialist, that is, someone who rejects the existence of anything immaterial. &hellip; Bargle, on the other hand, challenges Argle&rsquo;s materialism by introducing two further plausible positions, namely, that holes exist and that such holes are immaterial objects. It is plausible that holes exist: we seem to perceive holes; we refer to them in our language&hellip; It is also plausible that holes are immaterial things since our intuitive view of holes is that they are not tangible objects but rather seem more like gaps, and so are not material things themselves but are rather where the material things are not.

We could reject (1), which says that there are no immaterial objects, and instead hold that there <i>a<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i> immaterial things in the world, including holes.

The problem with this is that we say things such as: &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a hole in my bucket, dear Liza,&rsquo; and so we refer to holes. When we utter such a sentence, our words point to the hole in the bucket. If there are no holes, and so no such hole for our words to point at, then we need to reinterpret such sentences without making reference to holes. For example, we could make do with the language of objects being perforated, rather than objects having holes.... But can every truth about holes be reinterpreted and systematically paraphrased as truths about perforated host objects? And does the eliminability of the word in our language really provide us with evidence regarding the thing&rsquo;s actual existence? Ordinarily, we do not think that, by simply not talking about something, it ceases to exist. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">As for (3), which says that holes are immaterial objects: can that be rejected? Could holes be material rather than immaterial? Well, this was our central issue. If holes are material, <i>w<\/i><i>h<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>h<\/i> material thing are they?... Could they be part of the host, perhaps the lining of the hole? Maybe. But how thick is the lining for the hole? Should we take one millimetre thickness of the doughnut around the hole as constituting the hole? Or the entire width of the doughnut, namely, the entire host?... There are so many candidate linings of the hole, and it seems there is no reason to choose one over another, leaving it an arbitrary matter as to which lining we define and identify the hole with. And if we did not pick one of the linings, leaving a multitude of linings, then there would be a multitude of holes, one per each lining, all somewhere within the one doughnut. This seems like far too many holes in one place! It also leads to further oddities. For example, we do not think that we <i>e<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>t<\/i> the <i>h<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>e<\/i> of a doughnut when we eat the host lining of dough, do we?
