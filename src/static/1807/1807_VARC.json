Chomsky&#39;s analysis of America&#39;s most popular and omnipresent self-images is thorough and devastating. His careful scrutiny reveals them to be neither accurate nor rational.

Why expect societies to expose their actual inner workings when suitable rationalizations serve powerful interests far more effectively? Why are we shocked that that great powers manufacture the rationales for their self-interested pursuits using the most noble-sounding rhetoric? Why are we surprised that nations themselves, rather than powerful, specific interests within them, are depicted as acting for the well-being of society in foreign affairs? <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Chomsky&#39;s view is that the United States is not exempt from what is so reasonably expected from others. A rational approach will begin by looking for what is reasonable to expect of all nations. Chomsky expects to find great powers cloaking their aggressive self-interested quests in clouds of inspiring rhetoric, while all along a chorus of its supporters insist that it is uniquely exempt from the aggressive pursuits so easily depicted in its enemies. He suggests that a reasonable way to understand the foreign policy of any state begins by studying the domestic social structure. Who sets foreign policy? What interests do they represent? On what is their domestic power based? The policy that evolves can reasonably be expected to reflect the specific interests of those who shape it. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Further it is only reasonable to expect that the harsh facts of political life will be mystified if they threaten the faith; groups will emerge to disguise the obvious, to obfuscate the workings of power, to spin a web of mystification through transcendent, benign goals that allegedly guide national policy. Quite understandably, such people will not see themselves as a caste of propagandists or as indoctrinators. They prefer to think of themselves as educators, religious leaders, often as fervent apostles of truth which place them in conflict with the state. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Yet to see just what the shared consensus is in a society, Chomsky suggests, look at what the &ldquo;influential critics&rdquo; do not challenge.

Doves and hawks can reasonably be expected to differ on the exact nature of the evil practices, real or imagined, of current enemies of the state, but the debates will go on within a quite expectable narrow set of patriotic premises. Both speak of the nation as the active agent in international affairs, not specific groups within it.

Debates about Vietnam between hawks and doves might heatedly dispute whether the war was a costly mistake, an error or even a great tragedy. But responsible debate simply excludes from serious consideration that the war was wrong in principle or an act of aggression. Like George Orwell, Chomsky has an uncanny ability to suggest the ideological message in all its blatancy just beneath the apparently objective facade of argument. His statements startle &ndash; such as when he calls America&#39;s presence in South Vietnam an invasion. But his masterful use of comparisons exposes the ideological character underlying our political debate. Thus Chomsky compares South Vietnam and Afghanistan to show how little difficulty US observers have in spotting a Russian invasion of a country. If a puppet regime in Kabul requests Soviet military aid, there is no question that aggression is taking place. But when a puppet regime in South Vietnam requests US military aid, no aggression or invasion is even at issue. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1807_1"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu4":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'><b><\/b>Which of the following can be understood from the passage?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Because Chomsky does not belong to any intellectual school he is free to analyze as he thinks right.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Being well-versed with the domestic social structure of a country is a justifiable way to comprehend foreign policy of any state.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Chomsky's radical analysis of his country is tinged by remorse as he somehow identifies with the popular image portrayed by America.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Chomsky is happy with the fact that debates on the Vietnam war took into consideration not only the cost and economic losses that occurred but also acknowledged the fact that the act of war was wrong in principle or an act of aggression.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"4180","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>8<\/i><i>:<\/i> The long passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.

Both tend to argue that the &ldquo;national interests&rdquo; as articulated reflect such common interests as might be generally shared within society. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Chomsky skillfully demonstrates how this process works. Debates about Vietnam between hawks and doves might heatedly dispute whether the war was a costly mistake, an error or even a great tragedy. But responsible debate simply excludes from serious consideration that the war was wrong in principle or an act of aggression. Like George Orwell, Chomsky has an uncanny ability to suggest the ideological message in all its blatancy just beneath the apparently objective facade of argument. His statements startle &ndash; such as when he calls America&#39;s presence in South Vietnam an invasion. But his masterful use of comparisons exposes the ideological character underlying our political debate. Thus Chomsky compares South Vietnam and Afghanistan to show how little difficulty US observers have in spotting a Russian invasion of a country. If a puppet regime in Kabul requests Soviet military aid, there is no question that aggression is taking place. But when a puppet regime in South Vietnam requests US military aid, no aggression or invasion is even at issue. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1807_1"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"2","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"0","TIME":"0"},"qu9":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><i><b> <\/b><\/i><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i> <\/i><i>9<\/i><i>:<\/i><i><b> <\/b><\/i>Five sentences related to a topic are given below.

These movements stressed the need for community self-sufficiency in the face of a systemically racist white majoritarian society and although the black nationalist (black separatist) message was often simplistically opposed to the integrationism attributed to Martin Luther King and the Civil Rights Movement, their community development efforts &ndash; after-school arts programs for children, musical benefits to feed people struggling with food insecurity, &ldquo;neighborhood watch&rdquo; security efforts &ndash; still stand as tangible models for grassroots solidarity. The self-sufficiency message Kofsky finds in jazz proto-nationalism is a celebration of a unique African-American aesthetic, one that contested the aesthetic imperialism of the white critics who promoted the value and determined the negotiating power of the mostly black musicians within the system of white-owned recording and performance institutions. At the height of the free jazz movement, self-sufficiency imperatives were the driving force behind the independent recording facilities and cooperatively owned performance venues with which Coltrane and Coleman experimented. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1807_4"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu30":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><i><b> <\/b><\/i><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i>0<\/i><i>:<\/i><i><b> <\/b><\/i>Five sentences related to a topic are given below.

For example, English sentence structures focus on agents, and in our criminal-justice system, justice has been done when we&#39;ve found the transgressor and punished him or her accordingly (rather than finding the victims and restituting appropriately, an alternative approach to justice). So does the language shape cultural values, or does the influence go the other way, or both? <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">To demonstrate the causal role of language in shaping thoughts, one needs studies that directly manipulate language and look for effects in cognition. It turns out that if you change how people talk, that changes how they think. When bilingual people switch from one language to another, they start thinking differently. If you take away people&#39;s ability to use language in a simple nonlinguistic task, their performance can change dramatically, making them look no smarter than rats or infants. New research shows us that the languages we speak not only reflect or express our thoughts, but also shape the very thoughts we wish to express.<b> <\/b>The structures that exist in our languages profoundly shape how we construct reality, and help make us as smart and sophisticated as we are. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1807_5"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"}}
