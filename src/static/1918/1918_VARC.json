In the modern era, \u2018alienation\u2019 really came into its own as a talismanic term in the 1950s and \u201960s. At the time, the United States was becoming increasingly affluent, and earlier markers of oppression - poverty, inequality, social immobility, religious persecution - appeared to be on the wane.

Marx developed a three-pronged critique of the alienation of labour - the source, he claimed, of all other alienations in the capitalist world. In Marx\u2019s taxonomy of alienation, first came the worker\u2019s loss of control over the product of his or her labour, which was sold as a commodity in the marketplace for the profit of the capitalist. Second was his or her estrangement from the creative process of labouring itself; before the radical division of labour and inhumane efficiency of the assembly line, work was not a mere means of survival, but something in which pre-capitalist artisans found intrinsic reward. The third and final kind of alienation involves quashing the collective solidarity of the community, what Marx called human\u2019s \u2018species being\u2019, and which was lost with the rise of competitive individualism.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">On the strength of these insights, a school of thought known as \u2018Marxist Humanism\u2019 rose to prominence in the 1960s. Marxist Humanism was advanced by thinkers such as Erich Fromm, who questioned Marx\u2019s status as a scientific analyst of historical facts, and preferred to use his early writings as a way of probing how capitalism distorts the nature of human relations.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The prevailing assumption behind all of these accounts was that feeling estranged - whether from one\u2019s personal or communal identity, one\u2019s creations, or the human species as a whole - was a reason for profound dismay. Alienation could suggest, among other things, the domination of the subject by the object, the self by the other, the organic by the mechanical, and the living by the dead. Understood psychologically, socially, religiously or philosophically, it was a painful obstacle to feeling whole or at one with the world. Being settled in an identity and comfortable in one\u2019s skin were taken as preferable to being rootless, dispossessed or self-fractured. For the lucky few cosmopolitans, rootlessness might have meant being at home everywhere - but for those who felt like permanent exiles, it meant being at home nowhere.

Marx developed a three-pronged critique of the alienation of labour - the source, he claimed, of all other alienations in the capitalist world. In Marx\u2019s taxonomy of alienation, first came the worker\u2019s loss of control over the product of his or her labour, which was sold as a commodity in the marketplace for the profit of the capitalist. Second was his or her estrangement from the creative process of labouring itself; before the radical division of labour and inhumane efficiency of the assembly line, work was not a mere means of survival, but something in which pre-capitalist artisans found intrinsic reward.

Alienation could suggest, among other things, the domination of the subject by the object, the self by the other, the organic by the mechanical, and the living by the dead. Understood psychologically, socially, religiously or philosophically, it was a painful obstacle to feeling whole or at one with the world. Being settled in an identity and comfortable in one\u2019s skin were taken as preferable to being rootless, dispossessed or self-fractured.

Utopianisms are those ideas put into practice. This is where the trouble begins. The word means &lsquo;no place&rsquo; because when imperfect humans attempt perfectibility - personal, political, economic and social - they fail. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The belief that humans are perfectible leads, inevitably, to mistakes when &lsquo;a perfect society&rsquo; is designed for an imperfect species. There is no best way to live because there is so much variation in how people want to live. Therefore, there is no best society, only multiple variations on a handful of themes as dictated by our nature. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Utopias are especially vulnerable when a social theory based on collective ownership, communal work, authoritarian rule and a command-and-control economy collides with our natural-born desire for autonomy, individual freedom and choice. Moreover, the natural differences in ability, interests and preferences within any group of people leads to inequalities of outcomes and imperfect living and working conditions that utopias committed to equality of outcome cannot tolerate. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Most 19th-century utopian experiments were harmless because, without large numbers of members, they lacked political and economic power. But add those factors, and utopian dreamers can turn into dystopian murderers. People act on their beliefs, and if you believe that the only thing preventing you and\/or your family, clan, tribe, race or religion from going to heaven is someone else or some other group, then actions know no bounds. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We can see that calculus behind the utopian logic in the &lsquo;trolley problem&rsquo;. You are standing next to a fork in a railroad line with a switch to divert a trolley car that is about to kill five workers on the track. Pulling the switch will divert the trolley down a side track where it will kill one worker. If you do nothing, the trolley kills the five. Most people say that they would pull the switch. If even people in Western enlightened countries today agree that it is morally permissible to kill one person to save five, imagine how easy it is to convince people living in autocratic states with utopian aspirations to kill 1,000 to save 5,000, or to exterminate 1,000,000 so that 5,000,000 might prosper. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fatal flaw in utilitarian utopianism is found in another thought experiment: you are a healthy bystander in a hospital waiting room in which an ER physician has five patients dying from different conditions, all of which can be saved by sacrificing you and harvesting your organs. Would anyone want to live in a society in which they might be that innocent bystander? <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This is precisely what happened with the grand 20th-century experiments in utopian socialist ideologies as manifested in Marxist\/Leninist\/Stalinist Russia (1917-1989), Fascist Italy (1922-1943) and Nazi Germany (1933-1945), all large-scale attempts to achieve political, economic, social (and even racial) perfection, resulting in tens of millions of people murdered by their own states or killed in conflict with other states perceived to be blocking the road to paradise. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the second half of the 20th century, revolutionary Marxism led to murders, pogroms, genocides, ethnic cleansings, revolutions, civil wars and state-sponsored conflicts, all in the name of establishing a heaven on Earth that required the elimination of recalcitrant dissenters. Some 94 million people died at the hands of revolutionary Marxists and utopian communists in Russia, China, North Korea and other states. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p

Utopianisms are those ideas put into practice. This is where the trouble begins. The word means &lsquo;no place&rsquo; because when imperfect humans attempt perfectibility - personal, political, economic and social - they fail. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The belief that humans are perfectible leads, inevitably, to mistakes when &lsquo;a perfect society&rsquo; is designed for an imperfect species. There is no best way to live because there is so much variation in how people want to live. Therefore, there is no best society, only multiple variations on a handful of themes as dictated by our nature. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Utopias are especially vulnerable when a social theory based on collective ownership, communal work, authoritarian rule and a command-and-control economy collides with our natural-born desire for autonomy, individual freedom and choice. Moreover, the natural differences in ability, interests and preferences within any group of people leads to inequalities of outcomes and imperfect living and working conditions that utopias committed to equality of outcome cannot tolerate. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Most 19th-century utopian experiments were harmless because, without large numbers of members, they lacked political and economic power. But add those factors, and utopian dreamers can turn into dystopian murderers. People act on their beliefs, and if you believe that the only thing preventing you and\/or your family, clan, tribe, race or religion from going to heaven is someone else or some other group, then actions know no bounds. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We can see that calculus behind the utopian logic in the &lsquo;trolley problem&rsquo;. You are standing next to a fork in a railroad line with a switch to divert a trolley car that is about to kill five workers on the track. Pulling the switch will divert the trolley down a side track where it will kill one worker. If you do nothing, the trolley kills the five. Most people say that they would pull the switch. If even people in Western enlightened countries today agree that it is morally permissible to kill one person to save five, imagine how easy it is to convince people living in autocratic states with utopian aspirations to kill 1,000 to save 5,000, or to exterminate 1,000,000 so that 5,000,000 might prosper. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fatal flaw in utilitarian utopianism is found in another thought experiment: you are a healthy bystander in a hospital waiting room in which an ER physician has five patients dying from different conditions, all of which can be saved by sacrificing you and harvesting your organs.

Because a protopia contains as many new problems as new benefits, this complex interaction of working and broken is very hard to predict. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1918_1"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu9":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Which of the following best summarises the flaw in the \u2018flawed goal\u2019 Orwell refers to in the passage?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Human beings don\u2019t usually give in to a hedonistic attitude to life.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Struggle and sacrifice for a greater cause attracts human beings. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>A life of security isn\u2019t enough to keep human beings satisfied.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Human beings prefer struggle and self-sacrifice over security. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"c","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"5781","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>7<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>2<\/i><i>:<\/i> The passage given below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

Utopianisms are those ideas put into practice. This is where the trouble begins. The word means &lsquo;no place&rsquo; because when imperfect humans attempt perfectibility - personal, political, economic and social - they fail. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The belief that humans are perfectible leads, inevitably, to mistakes when &lsquo;a perfect society&rsquo; is designed for an imperfect species. There is no best way to live because there is so much variation in how people want to live. Therefore, there is no best society, only multiple variations on a handful of themes as dictated by our nature. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Utopias are especially vulnerable when a social theory based on collective ownership, communal work, authoritarian rule and a command-and-control economy collides with our natural-born desire for autonomy, individual freedom and choice. Moreover, the natural differences in ability, interests and preferences within any group of people leads to inequalities of outcomes and imperfect living and working conditions that utopias committed to equality of outcome cannot tolerate. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Most 19th-century utopian experiments were harmless because, without large numbers of members, they lacked political and economic power. But add those factors, and utopian dreamers can turn into dystopian murderers. People act on their beliefs, and if you believe that the only thing preventing you and\/or your family, clan, tribe, race or religion from going to heaven is someone else or some other group, then actions know no bounds. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We can see that calculus behind the utopian logic in the &lsquo;trolley problem&rsquo;. You are standing next to a fork in a railroad line with a switch to divert a trolley car that is about to kill five workers on the track. Pulling the switch will divert the trolley down a side track where it will kill one worker. If you do nothing, the trolley kills the five. Most people say that they would pull the switch. If even people in Western enlightened countries today agree that it is morally permissible to kill one person to save five, imagine how easy it is to convince people living in autocratic states with utopian aspirations to kill 1,000 to save 5,000, or to exterminate 1,000,000 so that 5,000,000 might prosper. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fatal flaw in utilitarian utopianism is found in another thought experiment: you are a healthy bystander in a hospital waiting room in which an ER physician has five patients dying from different conditions, all of which can be saved by sacrificing you and harvesting your organs. Would anyone want to live in a society in which they might be that innocent bystander? <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This is precisely what happened with the grand 20th-century experiments in utopian socialist ideologies as manifested in Marxist\/Leninist\/Stalinist Russia (1917-1989), Fascist Italy (1922-1943) and Nazi Germany (1933-1945), all large-scale attempts to achieve political, economic, social (and even racial) perfection, resulting in tens of millions of people murdered by their own states or killed in conflict with other states perceived to be blocking the road to paradise. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the second half of the 20th century, revolutionary Marxism led to murders, pogroms, genocides, ethnic cleansings, revolutions, civil wars and state-sponsored conflicts, all in the name of establishing a heaven on Earth that required the elimination of recalcitrant dissenters. Some 94 million people died at the hands of revolutionary Marxists and utopian communists in Russia, China, North Korea and other states. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p

Choose the best answer to each question. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>U<\/b>topias are idealised visions of a perfect society. Utopianisms are those ideas put into practice. This is where the trouble begins. The word means &lsquo;no place&rsquo; because when imperfect humans attempt perfectibility - personal, political, economic and social - they fail. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The belief that humans are perfectible leads, inevitably, to mistakes when &lsquo;a perfect society&rsquo; is designed for an imperfect species. There is no best way to live because there is so much variation in how people want to live. Therefore, there is no best society, only multiple variations on a handful of themes as dictated by our nature. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Utopias are especially vulnerable when a social theory based on collective ownership, communal work, authoritarian rule and a command-and-control economy collides with our natural-born desire for autonomy, individual freedom and choice. Moreover, the natural differences in ability, interests and preferences within any group of people leads to inequalities of outcomes and imperfect living and working conditions that utopias committed to equality of outcome cannot tolerate. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Most 19th-century utopian experiments were harmless because, without large numbers of members, they lacked political and economic power. But add those factors, and utopian dreamers can turn into dystopian murderers. People act on their beliefs, and if you believe that the only thing preventing you and\/or your family, clan, tribe, race or religion from going to heaven is someone else or some other group, then actions know no bounds. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We can see that calculus behind the utopian logic in the &lsquo;trolley problem&rsquo;. You are standing next to a fork in a railroad line with a switch to divert a trolley car that is about to kill five workers on the track. Pulling the switch will divert the trolley down a side track where it will kill one worker. If you do nothing, the trolley kills the five. Most people say that they would pull the switch. If even people in Western enlightened countries today agree that it is morally permissible to kill one person to save five, imagine how easy it is to convince people living in autocratic states with utopian aspirations to kill 1,000 to save 5,000, or to exterminate 1,000,000 so that 5,000,000 might prosper. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fatal flaw in utilitarian utopianism is found in another thought experiment: you are a healthy bystander in a hospital waiting room in which an ER physician has five patients dying from different conditions, all of which can be saved by sacrificing you and harvesting your organs.

Because a protopia contains as many new problems as new benefits, this complex interaction of working and broken is very hard to predict. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1918_1"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu11":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Which of the following cannot be understood, from the passage, to be a consequence of the quest for Utopia?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>People indulging in genocides and ethnic cleansing in the hope of a greater heaven.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The widespread acceptance of revolutionary Marxism as a fundamental ideology.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The state-sponsored pogroms aimed at silencing the dissenters.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The state indulging in large-scale attempts to achieve political, economic, social and even racial perfection.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"5781","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>7<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>2<\/i><i>:<\/i> The passage given below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

Utopianisms are those ideas put into practice. This is where the trouble begins. The word means &lsquo;no place&rsquo; because when imperfect humans attempt perfectibility - personal, political, economic and social - they fail. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The belief that humans are perfectible leads, inevitably, to mistakes when &lsquo;a perfect society&rsquo; is designed for an imperfect species. There is no best way to live because there is so much variation in how people want to live. Therefore, there is no best society, only multiple variations on a handful of themes as dictated by our nature. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Utopias are especially vulnerable when a social theory based on collective ownership, communal work, authoritarian rule and a command-and-control economy collides with our natural-born desire for autonomy, individual freedom and choice. Moreover, the natural differences in ability, interests and preferences within any group of people leads to inequalities of outcomes and imperfect living and working conditions that utopias committed to equality of outcome cannot tolerate. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Most 19th-century utopian experiments were harmless because, without large numbers of members, they lacked political and economic power. But add those factors, and utopian dreamers can turn into dystopian murderers. People act on their beliefs, and if you believe that the only thing preventing you and\/or your family, clan, tribe, race or religion from going to heaven is someone else or some other group, then actions know no bounds. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We can see that calculus behind the utopian logic in the &lsquo;trolley problem&rsquo;. You are standing next to a fork in a railroad line with a switch to divert a trolley car that is about to kill five workers on the track. Pulling the switch will divert the trolley down a side track where it will kill one worker. If you do nothing, the trolley kills the five. Most people say that they would pull the switch. If even people in Western enlightened countries today agree that it is morally permissible to kill one person to save five, imagine how easy it is to convince people living in autocratic states with utopian aspirations to kill 1,000 to save 5,000, or to exterminate 1,000,000 so that 5,000,000 might prosper. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fatal flaw in utilitarian utopianism is found in another thought experiment: you are a healthy bystander in a hospital waiting room in which an ER physician has five patients dying from different conditions, all of which can be saved by sacrificing you and harvesting your organs. Would anyone want to live in a society in which they might be that innocent bystander? <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This is precisely what happened with the grand 20th-century experiments in utopian socialist ideologies as manifested in Marxist\/Leninist\/Stalinist Russia (1917-1989), Fascist Italy (1922-1943) and Nazi Germany (1933-1945), all large-scale attempts to achieve political, economic, social (and even racial) perfection, resulting in tens of millions of people murdered by their own states or killed in conflict with other states perceived to be blocking the road to paradise. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the second half of the 20th century, revolutionary Marxism led to murders, pogroms, genocides, ethnic cleansings, revolutions, civil wars and state-sponsored conflicts, all in the name of establishing a heaven on Earth that required the elimination of recalcitrant dissenters. Some 94 million people died at the hands of revolutionary Marxists and utopian communists in Russia, China, North Korea and other states. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p

Utopianisms are those ideas put into practice. This is where the trouble begins. The word means &lsquo;no place&rsquo; because when imperfect humans attempt perfectibility - personal, political, economic and social - they fail. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The belief that humans are perfectible leads, inevitably, to mistakes when &lsquo;a perfect society&rsquo; is designed for an imperfect species. There is no best way to live because there is so much variation in how people want to live. Therefore, there is no best society, only multiple variations on a handful of themes as dictated by our nature. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Utopias are especially vulnerable when a social theory based on collective ownership, communal work, authoritarian rule and a command-and-control economy collides with our natural-born desire for autonomy, individual freedom and choice. Moreover, the natural differences in ability, interests and preferences within any group of people leads to inequalities of outcomes and imperfect living and working conditions that utopias committed to equality of outcome cannot tolerate. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Most 19th-century utopian experiments were harmless because, without large numbers of members, they lacked political and economic power. But add those factors, and utopian dreamers can turn into dystopian murderers. People act on their beliefs, and if you believe that the only thing preventing you and\/or your family, clan, tribe, race or religion from going to heaven is someone else or some other group, then actions know no bounds. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We can see that calculus behind the utopian logic in the &lsquo;trolley problem&rsquo;. You are standing next to a fork in a railroad line with a switch to divert a trolley car that is about to kill five workers on the track. Pulling the switch will divert the trolley down a side track where it will kill one worker. If you do nothing, the trolley kills the five. Most people say that they would pull the switch. If even people in Western enlightened countries today agree that it is morally permissible to kill one person to save five, imagine how easy it is to convince people living in autocratic states with utopian aspirations to kill 1,000 to save 5,000, or to exterminate 1,000,000 so that 5,000,000 might prosper. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fatal flaw in utilitarian utopianism is found in another thought experiment: you are a healthy bystander in a hospital waiting room in which an ER physician has five patients dying from different conditions, all of which can be saved by sacrificing you and harvesting your organs.

It furnishes the imagination with its ideas, converses with its objects at the greatest distance, and continues the longest in action without being tired or satiated with its proper enjoyments. We cannot, indeed, have a single image in the fancy that did not make its first entrance through the sight; but we have the power of retaining, altering, and compounding those images, which we have once received, into all the varieties of picture and vision that are most agreeable to the imagination. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The words &#39;fancy&#39; and &#39;imagination&#39; are normally employed in an uncircumscribed sense and therefore I thought it necessary to fix the notion of these two words, as I intend to make use of them in the thread of my following speculations, for the reader&#39;s sake. By the pleasures of the imagination, I mean only such pleasures as arise originally from sight, and I divide these pleasures into two kinds viz the primary pleasures of the imagination, which entirely proceed from objects which are before our eyes; and the secondary pleasures of the imagination which flow from the ideas of visible objects, when the objects are not actually before the eye, but are called up into our memories, or formed into agreeable visions of things that are either absent or fictitious. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The pleasures of the imagination, taken in their full extent, are not so gross as those of sense, nor so refined as those of the understanding. The last are, indeed, more preferable, because they are founded on some new knowledge or improvement in the mind of man; yet it must be confessed that those of the imagination are as great and as transporting as the other. A beautiful prospect delights the soul, as much as a demonstration; and a description in Homer has charmed more readers than a chapter in Aristotle.

The turbulence of the mid-20th century shaped him intellectually. &ldquo;After World War II, I found myself preoccupied by a single word, &#39;Culture&#39;,&rdquo; Williams would write as he pursued his Master&#39;s Degree at Cambridge University. His fascination with &ldquo;culture&rdquo; persisted and it would lead him to write the book that made him famous. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Published in 1958, <i>C<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>S<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>y<\/i><i> <\/i>centers on the idea that changes in the significance - both the meanings and importance - of particular words can illuminate the process of historical change. Williams focuses on a set of terms - &ldquo;industry,&rdquo; &ldquo;democracy,&rdquo; &ldquo;class,&rdquo; &ldquo;art,&rdquo; and &ldquo;culture&rdquo; - whose evolution tracked the massive shifts that took place in Britain at the time of the Industrial Revolution. &ldquo;The changes in their use,&rdquo; Williams writes, &ldquo;bear witness to a general change in our characteristic ways of thinking about our common life: about our social, political and economic institutions; about the purposes which these institutions are designed to embody; and about the relations to these institutions and purposes of our activities in learning, education and the arts.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is the relations within this general pattern of change,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;which it will be my particular task to describe.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Williams proceeds to do this by examining a series of writers and thinkers from both the right and the left. For instance, in a section called &ldquo;Contrasts,&rdquo; he pairs the conservative Edmund Burke with the rabble-rousing journalist William Cobbett, and the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham with the Romantic poet-critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Despite the intensity of his own political commitments, Williams is a generous reader; he patiently reconstructs the arguments of others. This evenhandedness is part of the point. Williams insists that, although his subjects put forth conflicting or opposing arguments, they were in fact reacting to the same historical forces. <b> <\/b> <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">After World War II, Williams found himself preoccupied by a single word &#39;culture&#39;. The word comes from the Latin verb &#39;<i>c<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e&#39;<\/i><i>&nbsp;<\/i>and originally meant &ldquo;to cultivate,&rdquo; in the sense of tending farmland. A &ldquo;noun of process,&rdquo; it gradually expanded to include human development, and by the late 18th century, people commonly used &ldquo;culture&rdquo; to mean how we cultivate ourselves. Following the Industrial Revolution, however, the word took on a new emphasis: It came to mean both an entire way of life (as in &ldquo;folk&rdquo; or &ldquo;Japanese&rdquo; culture) and a realm of aesthetic or intellectual activity that stood apart from, or above, the everyday (basically, what people parody when they say &ldquo;culchah&rdquo;). Over several hundred pages, Williams shows how dozens of writers developed these senses of &ldquo;culture&rdquo; in order to explain, and manage, the changes remaking British society in the 19th century - from rapid industrialization to the new markets it created for literature, and from land enclosure to overseas colonization. <i>C<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>S<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>y<\/i><i> <\/i>departs from the traditional Marxist idea that economic relations dictate or determine the shapes that culture takes. Rather, &ldquo;the arts of writing and the arts of creation and performance, over their whole range, are parts of a cultural process&hellip;. What we permanently have are not objects but notations.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Williams originally intended to include his collection of &ldquo;keywords&rdquo; as an appendix to <i>C<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>S<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>y<\/i>. But his publisher balked at the idea of adding them to a book of dense prose that already ran to over 400 pages, so Williams shelved it. <i>C<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>S<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>y<\/i> went on to sell more than 200,000 copies.

By 1976, he was able to publish <i>K<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>y<\/i><i>w<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>d<\/i><i>s<\/i> as a stand-alone volume on the strength of his reputation.

The turbulence of the mid-20th century shaped him intellectually. &ldquo;After World War II, I found myself preoccupied by a single word, &#39;Culture&#39;,&rdquo; Williams would write as he pursued his Master&#39;s Degree at Cambridge University. His fascination with &ldquo;culture&rdquo; persisted and it would lead him to write the book that made him famous. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Published in 1958, <i>C<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>S<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>y<\/i><i> <\/i>centers on the idea that changes in the significance - both the meanings and importance - of particular words can illuminate the process of historical change. Williams focuses on a set of terms - &ldquo;industry,&rdquo; &ldquo;democracy,&rdquo; &ldquo;class,&rdquo; &ldquo;art,&rdquo; and &ldquo;culture&rdquo; - whose evolution tracked the massive shifts that took place in Britain at the time of the Industrial Revolution. &ldquo;The changes in their use,&rdquo; Williams writes, &ldquo;bear witness to a general change in our characteristic ways of thinking about our common life: about our social, political and economic institutions; about the purposes which these institutions are designed to embody; and about the relations to these institutions and purposes of our activities in learning, education and the arts.&rdquo; &ldquo;It is the relations within this general pattern of change,&rdquo; he continues, &ldquo;which it will be my particular task to describe.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Williams proceeds to do this by examining a series of writers and thinkers from both the right and the left. For instance, in a section called &ldquo;Contrasts,&rdquo; he pairs the conservative Edmund Burke with the rabble-rousing journalist William Cobbett, and the utilitarian philosopher Jeremy Bentham with the Romantic poet-critic Samuel Taylor Coleridge. Despite the intensity of his own political commitments, Williams is a generous reader; he patiently reconstructs the arguments of others. This evenhandedness is part of the point. Williams insists that, although his subjects put forth conflicting or opposing arguments, they were in fact reacting to the same historical forces. <b> <\/b> <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">After World War II, Williams found himself preoccupied by a single word &#39;culture&#39;. The word comes from the Latin verb &#39;<i>c<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e&#39;<\/i><i>&nbsp;<\/i>and originally meant &ldquo;to cultivate,&rdquo; in the sense of tending farmland. A &ldquo;noun of process,&rdquo; it gradually expanded to include human development, and by the late 18th century, people commonly used &ldquo;culture&rdquo; to mean how we cultivate ourselves. Following the Industrial Revolution, however, the word took on a new emphasis: It came to mean both an entire way of life (as in &ldquo;folk&rdquo; or &ldquo;Japanese&rdquo; culture) and a realm of aesthetic or intellectual activity that stood apart from, or above, the everyday (basically, what people parody when they say &ldquo;culchah&rdquo;). Over several hundred pages, Williams shows how dozens of writers developed these senses of &ldquo;culture&rdquo; in order to explain, and manage, the changes remaking British society in the 19th century - from rapid industrialization to the new markets it created for literature, and from land enclosure to overseas colonization. <i>C<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>S<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>y<\/i><i> <\/i>departs from the traditional Marxist idea that economic relations dictate or determine the shapes that culture takes. Rather, &ldquo;the arts of writing and the arts of creation and performance, over their whole range, are parts of a cultural process&hellip;. What we permanently have are not objects but notations.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Williams originally intended to include his collection of &ldquo;keywords&rdquo; as an appendix to <i>C<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>S<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>y<\/i>. But his publisher balked at the idea of adding them to a book of dense prose that already ran to over 400 pages, so Williams shelved it. <i>C<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>S<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>y<\/i> went on to sell more than 200,000 copies.
