We ask whether there cannot also be \u2018artificial\u2019 science - knowledge about artificial objects and phenomena.\u201d In line with Simon\u2019s vision, we advocate the need for a new, distinct scientific discipline of Machine Behaviour: the scientific study of behaviour exhibited by intelligent machines.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This new discipline is concerned with the scientific study of machines, not as engineering artefacts, but as a new class of actors with their unique behavioural patterns and ecology. Crucially, this field overlaps with, but is distinct from computer science and robotics, as it treats machine behaviour observationally and experimentally, without necessarily appealing to the machine\u2019s internal mechanisms. Machine Behaviour is akin to how the fields of animal behaviour - also known as ethology - and behavioural ecology study the behaviour of animals without necessarily focusing on physiology or biochemistry.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Our definition of the new field of Machine Behaviour comes with some caveats. Studying machine behaviour does not imply that AI algorithms have agency - in the sense that they are socially responsible for their actions. If someone\u2019s dog bites a bystander, it is the owner of the dog who is held responsible. Nonetheless, it is useful to study - and therefore effectively predict - dog behaviour. Similarly, machines are embedded in a larger socio-technical fabric, with human stakeholders who are responsible for deploying them, and for the harm they may cause to others.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">A second caveat is that machines exhibit behaviours that are fundamentally different from animals and humans, so we must avoid any tendency to excessively anthropomorphize or zoomorphize machines. Even if borrowing scientific methods from the study of human and animal behaviour may prove useful for the study of machines, machines may exhibit forms of intelligence and behavioural patterns that are qualitatively different - even alien.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1916"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu14":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Which of the following statements, if falsified, will weaken the need for \u2018breaking the fourth wall\u2019?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Theater at its core needs to keep the audience informed as much as possible about the development of the plot and the characters.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The absence of direct communication with the audience of a play distances them from the main happenings on the stage.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Not every play needs audience engagement in order to be a success. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Directly addressing the audience isn\u2019t the only way of engaging the audience.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"5876","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>4<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>6<\/i><i>:<\/i> The passage given below is accompanied by a set of three questions.

Every time that an animal eats a plant or another animal the conversion of food biomass into the consumer\u2019s biomass involves an efficiency of much less than 100 percent: typically, around 10 percent. That is, it takes around 10000 pounds of corn to grow a 1000-pound cow. If instead you want to grow 1000 pounds of carnivore, you have to feed it 10000 pounds of herbivores grown on 100,000 pounds of corn. Even among herbivores and omnivores, many species like koalas, are too finicky in their plant preferences to recommend themselves as farm animals. As a result of this fundamental inefficiency, no mammalian carnivore has ever been domesticated for food. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Growth rate.

Nevertheless, some large animals have much nastier dispositions and are more incurably dangerous than are others. Tendencies to kill humans have disqualified many otherwise seemingly ideal candidates for domestication. One obvious example is the grizzly bear. Bear meat is an expensive delicacy, grizzlies weigh up to 1700 pounds, they are mainly vegetarians (though formidable hunters), their vegetable diet is very broad, they thrive on human garbage and they grow relatively fast.

To be domesticated, a candidate wild species must possess many different characteristics. Lack of any single required characteristic dooms efforts at domestication, just as it dooms efforts at building a happy marriage. Playing marriage counsellor to the zebra-human couple and other ill-sorted pairs, we can recognize at least six groups of reasons for failed domestication. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Diet. Every time that an animal eats a plant or another animal the conversion of food biomass into the consumer\u2019s biomass involves an efficiency of much less than 100 percent: typically, around 10 percent. That is, it takes around 10000 pounds of corn to grow a 1000-pound cow. If instead you want to grow 1000 pounds of carnivore, you have to feed it 10000 pounds of herbivores grown on 100,000 pounds of corn. Even among herbivores and omnivores, many species like koalas, are too finicky in their plant preferences to recommend themselves as farm animals. As a result of this fundamental inefficiency, no mammalian carnivore has ever been domesticated for food. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Growth rate. To be worth keeping, domesticates must also grow quickly. That eliminates gorillas and elephants, even though they are the vegetarians with admirably non-finicky food preferences and represent a lot of meat.

Naturally, almost any mammal species that is sufficiently large is capable of killing a human. People have been killed by pigs, horses, camels, and cattle. Nevertheless, some large animals have much nastier dispositions and are more incurably dangerous than are others. Tendencies to kill humans have disqualified many otherwise seemingly ideal candidates for domestication. One obvious example is the grizzly bear. Bear meat is an expensive delicacy, grizzlies weigh up to 1700 pounds, they are mainly vegetarians (though formidable hunters), their vegetable diet is very broad, they thrive on human garbage and they grow relatively fast. If they behaved themselves in captivity, grizzlies would be a fabulous meat production animal. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Tendency to panic. Big mammalian herbivore species react to danger from predators or humans in different ways. Some species are nervous, fast, and programmed for instant flight when they perceive a threat. Other species are slower, less nervous, seek protection in herds, stand their ground when threatened, and don\u2019t run until necessary. Naturally, the nervous species are difficult to keep in captivity. If put into an enclosure, they are likely to panic, and either die of shock or batter themselves to death against the fence in their attempts to escape. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Social structure. Almost all species of domesticated large mammals prove to be ones whose wild ancestors share three social characteristics: they live in herds; they maintain a well-developed dominance hierarchy among herd members; and the herds occupy overlapping home ranges rather than mutually exclusive territories. When the herd is on the move, its members maintain a stereotyped order so that many adults can coexist in the herd without constant fighting and with each knowing its rank.

The first human ancestors appeared between five million and seven million years ago, probably when some apelike creatures in Africa began to walk habitually on two legs. They were flaking crude stone tools by 2.5 million years ago. Then some of them spread from Africa into Asia and Europe after two million years ago. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">With somewhat less certainty, most scientists think that people who look like us - anatomically modern Homo sapiens -- evolved by at least 130,000 years ago from ancestors who had remained in Africa. Their brain had reached today&#39;s size. They, too, moved out of Africa and eventually replaced nonmodern human species, notably the Neanderthals in Europe. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But agreement breaks down completely on the question of when, where and how these anatomically modern humans began to manifest creative thinking, and become fully human in behavior as well as body? ... <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">For much of the last century, archaeologists thought that modern behavior flowered relatively recently, 40,000 years ago, and only after Homo sapiens had pushed into Europe. But some rebellious researchers suspected that this theory was a relic of a time when their discipline was ruled by Eurocentrism and said that archaeologists were not looking for earlier creativity in the right places. Several recent discoveries in Africa are providing physical evidence to support an older, more gradual evolution of modern behavior, one not centered in Europe. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The uncertainty over the origin of modern cultural behavior stems from what appears to be a great time lag between the point when the species first looked modern and when it acted modern. &quot;The earliest Homo sapiens probably had the cognitive capability to invent Sputnik,&quot; said Dr. Sally McBrearty, an anthropologist at the University of Connecticut. &quot;But they didn&#39;t yet have the history of invention or a need for those things.&quot;<\/font><\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The foremost proponent of the traditional theory that human creativity appeared suddenly and mainly in Europe is Dr. Richard G. Klein, a Stanford archaeologist. In his view, 40,000 years ago was the turning point in human creativity, when modern Homo sapiens arrived in Europe and left the first unambiguous artifacts of abstract and symbolic thought. They were making more advanced tools out of bone, burying their dead with ceremony and expressing a new kind of self-awareness with beads and pendants for body ornamentation and in finely wrought figurines of the female form. They mastered long-distance trade and complex stone technology, and had a more varied diet. As time passed, they projected on cave walls something of their lives and minds in splendid paintings of deer, horses and wild bulls seen in caves in Lascaux and Chauvet, France. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">As an explanation for this apparently abrupt flowering (&#39;dawn&#39;) of creativity, Dr. Klein has proposed a neurological hypothesis. About 50,000 years ago, he contends, a chance genetic mutation in effect rewired the brain in some critical way, possibly allowing for a significant advance in speech which could have enabled people &quot;to model complex natural and social circumstances&quot; and give them &quot;the fully modern ability to invent culture.&quot; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Although this transformation, with the genetic change leading to the behavioral change, occurred in Africa, Dr. Klein writes, it allowed &quot;human populations to colonize challenging environments.&quot; On reaching Europe, the rewired modern humans (Cro-Magnons), presumably outsmarted the resident Neanderthals, driving them to extinction by 30,000 years ago, and leaving their indelible cultural mark on the land. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Dr. Klein concedes that the idea &quot;fails one important measure of a proper scientific hypothesis -- it cannot be tested or falsified by experiment.&quot;Skulls from that time show no change in brain size and are highly unlikely to show a genetic change in the brain&#39;s functioning. Although he considers the idea the most straightforward explanation, critics object that such a concept of an abrupt &quot;human revolution&quot; is too simplistic, as well as being unprovable. ... <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the last 30 years, scientists have learned that the Cro-Magnons originated in Africa and the Neanderthals evolved exclusively in Europe. So archaeologists have begun searching more diligently in Africa for attributes of early modern behavior. Based on evidence, Dr. McBrearty at UConn and Dr. Alison S. Brooks of George Washington University said the many artifacts indicative of modern behavior in Africa did &quot;not occur suddenly together, as predicted by the &#39;human revolution&#39; model, but at sites that are widely separated in space and time.&quot; Exploring a cave at the southern tip of Africa, they concluded that the anatomically modern people there were turning animal bones into awls and finely polished weapon points more than 70,000 years ago. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1916_4"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu30":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Which of the following, if true, weakens the comment: \u201cThe earliest Homo sapiens probably had the cognitive capability to invent Sputnik but they didn't yet have ... a need for those things.''
