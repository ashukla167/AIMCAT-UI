He proposed illumination by oil lamps and ventilation by a series of chimneys projecting above the surface of the Channel. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Mathieu-Favier was successful in bringing his project to the attention of Napoleon Bonaparte, who in 1802 was the first Consul of France. Napoleon was impressed with the project and at the Peace of Amiens discussed the fixed link idea with the prescient Whig leader, Charles James Fox. Both Napoleon and Fox supported Mathieu-Favier&#39;s project to build a Channel Tunnel.

Moreover, the pollution from the traffic jams, which signals that business is good at the local gas stations, is contributing to environmental ills.

GDP is an index of a country&rsquo;s entire economic output &minus; a tally of manufacturers&rsquo; shipments, farmers&rsquo; harvests, retail sales and construction spending. It compresses the immensity of a national economy into a single data point of surpassing density.&nbsp; Many have depended on it for so long. &ldquo;If you want to know why GDP matters, you can just put yourself back in the 1930 period, where we had no idea what was happening to our economy,&rdquo; said William Nordhaus, a Yale economist. &ldquo;There were people then who said things were fine and others who said things weren&rsquo;t fine. But we had no comprehensive measures, so we looked at things like boxcar loadings.&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tBut academics and gadflies have always been critical of the measure, suggesting that it is an inaccurate gauge of prosperity. It has failed to capture the well-being of a 20th-century society and has skewed global political objectives toward the single-minded pursuit of economic growth. &hellip;.

When we suppress emotions with our conscious mind we are essentially training our sub-conscious mind to accept these negative emotional feelings as normal. If this is done continuously, the sub-conscious mind can become confused and polarised. Negative life events will often start to seem acceptable and normal to the individual. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">A normal healthy emotional and physical state becomes almost abnormal and this makes it more difficult to break out of the spiral of negative emotion and ill health. Take, for example, an abusive relationship where the suffering party, rather than end the relationship, suppresses their emotions and convinces themselves that everything is fine. Even a physically and emotionally destructive relationship can continue for a long period of time, and when the relationship finally comes to an end, the injured party will often feel guilty and reject future nurturing relationships, gravitating instead towards an equally abusive relationship. The key to resolving such patterns is to re-train the sub-conscious mind to express negative emotions correctly. In the clinic, this process is often aided by the release of suppressed emotions. This explains the frequent occurrence where clients will often experience an emotional release during or shortly after an acupuncture treatment, often without knowing where this emotion came from. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In my clinic I regularly encounter clients who seem trapped in a chain of negative emotions. For example, if someone feels unreasonably frustrated or angry towards someone, whether they express or repress this emotion, they will often feel very upset afterwards. This will often lead to feelings of guilt and low self-worth where ultimately they redirect this anger towards themselves. If this chaining of negative emotions happens continuously over time it can often lead to severe anxiety or depression. So an initial negative emotion spirals into a whole series of lingering negative emotions &minus; each one damaging to the person. The secret is to chain and spiral positive emotions of confidence, self-worth and joy and in that process help the client to release and ultimately to collapse the negative emotional feelings. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Acupuncture can be very helpful in achieving our goal.

When we suppress emotions with our conscious mind we are essentially training our sub-conscious mind to accept these negative emotional feelings as normal.

Take, for example, an abusive relationship where the suffering party, rather than end the relationship, suppresses their emotions and convinces themselves that everything is fine. Even a physically and emotionally destructive relationship can continue for a long period of time, and when the relationship finally comes to an end, the injured party will often feel guilty and reject future nurturing relationships, gravitating instead towards an equally abusive relationship. The key to resolving such patterns is to re-train the sub-conscious mind to express negative emotions correctly. In the clinic, this process is often aided by the release of suppressed emotions.

Asian countries are furiously upgrading their militaries, but their combined military spending in 2008 was still only a third that of the United States. Even at current torrid rates of growth, it will take the average Asian 77 years to reach the income of the average American. The Chinese need 47 years. For Indians, the figure is 123 years.

China and Japan have fought repeatedly over Korea; the Soviet Union teamed up with India and Vietnam to check China, while China supported Pakistan to counterbalance India.

Pax Americana was made possible not only by the overwhelming economic and military might of the United States but also by a set of visionary ideas: free trade, Wilsonian liberalism, and multilateral institutions. Although Asia today may have the world&rsquo;s most dynamic economies, it does not seem to play an equally inspiring role as a thought leader, when it actually should, given the circumstances.

But the region faces enormous demographic hurdles in the decades ahead. More than 20 percent of Asians will be elderly by 2050. Aging is a principal cause of Japan&rsquo;s stagnation. China&rsquo;s elderly population will soar in the middle of the next decade. Its savings rate will fall while healthcare and pension costs explode.

One advantage of 3D face recognition is that it is not affected by changes in lighting like other techniques. _______________(5)______________ It can also identify a face from a range of viewing angles, including a profile view. Three-dimensional data points from a face vastly improve the precision of face recognition. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"3","CORRECT_ANSWER":"3","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"2","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"0","TIME":"0"},"qu28":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>8<\/i><i>:<\/i><i> <\/i>Five sentences (labelled 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) are given in the following question.

Polygraphs were used in post-conviction sex-offender maintenance programmes. As part of their probation programmes in a typical jurisdiction, released sex-offenders were required to submit to periodic polygraph examinations. But the courts have cast a skeptical eye on the relevance and suitability of polygraph test results as legal evidence. They are well justified in their attitude. Generalizing from the available scientific evidence of a particular polygraph examination is fraught with difficulty. The courts should extend their reluctance to rely on the polygraph for many quasi-forensic uses such as the sex-offender management programmes. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">While, in the US law enforcement and intelligence communities, the polygraph has become a desired method for identifying and pinning down suspects, it leaves a lot to be desired as an evidence gathering tool, not only in such settings but also in quasi-forensic applications such as the sex-offender management programmes. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Polygraphs were used in post-conviction sex-offender maintenance programmes in the past.

We naturally see the world from our own perspective and see our own point of view as obvious and, if we are not careful, as the only possible one. I have never heard anyone say: &ldquo;Yes, you only see things from <i>m<\/i><i>y<\/i> point of view. Why don&rsquo;t you consider your own for a change?&rdquo; The more our culture presumes its own perspective, the more our academic disciplines presume their own rectitude, and the more professors restrict students to their own way of looking at things, the less students will be able to escape from habitual, self-centered, self-reinforcing judgments. We grow wiser, and we understand ourselves better, if we can put ourselves in the position of those who think differently. Literature, by teaching us to imagine the other&rsquo;s perspective, teaches the habits of mind that prevent the opposition of diverse opinion. Great literature allows one to think and feel from within how other cultures think and feel. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Everyone has absolute confidence in the accuracy of their own perspective, sometimes convinced that all others are erroneous. Allowing such an attitude to hold sway in our cultures, especially in academic pedagogy, would result in its perpetuation. It is necessary to be able to understand and accept the way others see things, and literature, with its presentation of diverse views and cultural thinking, would help in such an endeavour. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We are as deeply convinced of the obvious correctness of our perceptions as others are of theirs.

The problem of self exists in cultures and academic disciplines because we do not think beyond our own perspective and ignore the opinions of others.
