This strategy recently came under fire at the Cannes Film Festival, with members of the festival board and French film industry&rsquo;s governing body arguing that movies without serious runs in physical movie theatres shouldn&rsquo;t qualify in a film competition. But Netflix CEO, Reed Hastings has said repeatedly that Netflix doesn&rsquo;t envision a world where movie theatres don&rsquo;t exist, and that he believes that the future of film has room for plenty of different distribution strategies. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Director Bong Joon-ho, whose latest movie Okja was boycotted by South Korean movie chains because of its Netflix release, has said in several interviews that the release strategy doesn&rsquo;t bother him because a partnership with Netflix also comes with complete creative freedom and a generous budget: &ldquo;The best way to watch a film is in the theatre. But for directors who make weird films like mine, the digital studio platforms are a great creative opportunity. I do believe that the two modes can coexist.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Nolan brushed this argument off, saying, &ldquo;I think the investment that Netflix is putting into interesting filmmakers and interesting projects would be more admirable if it weren&rsquo;t being used as some kind of bizarre leverage against shutting down theatres. It&rsquo;s so pointless. I don&rsquo;t really get it.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">He then said, &ldquo;The only platform I&rsquo;m interested in talking about is theatrical exhibition,&rdquo; a comment which drew quick criticism from director Ava DuVernay. DuVernay&rsquo;s Netflix documentary <i>1<\/i><i>3<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>h<\/i> was nominated for an Oscar this year and she&rsquo;s currently working on another about the Central Park Five. She&rsquo;s also a major studio director, midway through production for Disney&rsquo;s $100 million adaptation of A Wrinkle in Time. On Twitter, she asked Nolan, &ldquo;But, what if there&#39;s no movie theatre in your neighbourhood?&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">DuVernay&rsquo;s point is a crucial one about the future of film. You can love and support movie theatres, and Nolan is free to personally care about theatrical releases, but it&rsquo;s ridiculous to argue that there&rsquo;s no value in Netflix releasing films for a truly global audience. Netflix&rsquo;s model gives its 100 million subscribers, in 190 countries, access to movies at the same time, rather than the traditional system of the US or UK getting films first, and other markets waiting months. And many people who might not be able to afford more than one monthly trip to the ever-more-expensive movie theatre can afford a monthly Netflix subscription.

Light aircraft fly photographers close to America\u2019s oil-storage facilities, using infra-red imaging and photographs to gauge the rise and fall of levels of crude in 2,100 storage tanks, in an attempt to work out whether oil futures are overvalued or not.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In fact, it is less mischievous than that. The intelligence-gatherers work for a company, Genscape, that sells the information to traders everywhere, giving them a few days\u2019 jump before storage surveys are published by the government.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">These data are particularly useful at a time when near-record levels of oil inventories in America are weighing on oil prices and frustrating attempts by OPEC, the producers\u2019 cartel, to prop up the market. The high level of inventories is vital to an understanding of why crude prices suddenly plummeted this month, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA), a forecaster. West Texas Intermediate is back below $50 a barrel, its level before OPEC in November agreed to cut output.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Why are the tanks so full? Firstly, OPEC\u2019s agreement with non-members such as Russia to cut production from January 1st set off a flurry of hedge-fund buying, pushing oil prices higher. American shale producers were quick to take advantage of higher prices by pumping more oil. The number of American oil rigs has risen to 617 from 386 a year ago, producing 400,000 barrels a day more than at the lows in September. Much of that has gone to storage terminals like Cushing, Oklahoma.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Second, OPEC has been hoisted by its own petard. In the months before it started cutting output, it sharply raised production and exports. After weeks of trans-Atlantic travel, this oil is showing up in higher American imports, put into storage when refineries were idled for maintenance.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The third factor is the shape of the curve of futures prices, which is closely related to the level of inventories. When OPEC orchestrated the January cut, it hoped to rebalance supply and demand by mid-year, and push the futures market into \u201cbackwardation\u201d, meaning prices in the long term were at a discount to short-term prices. Backwardation reflects the market\u2019s willingness to buy oil and use it rather than buy oil and store it. The strategy worked for a while.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But since the release of bearish American inventory data on March 8th, the market slipped back into \u201ccontango\u201d, the name for the discount at which near-term prices trade to longer-term ones. Hillary Stevenson of Genscape notes that the storage costs in tanks in Cushing are about 41 cents per barrel of oil per month, compared with a one-month contango of about 65 cents.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Contango can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, because the more oil is stored, the lower short-term prices go.

We can\u2019t predict with certainty that a particular child will do better in a specific charter or traditional public school. Social scientists can confirm only whether, on average, a given treatment is beneficial for a given population. Not all charter schools are outstanding: In the suburbs, for example, the evidence is that they do no better than traditional public schools. But they have been shown to improve the education of disadvantaged children at scale, in multiple cities, over many years.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Charter schools are publicly funded but not bound by many of the rules that constrain traditional public schools. Charters, for example, can easily try new curriculums or teaching strategies, or choose to have a longer school day. They have more autonomy than traditional public schools in hiring and firing teachers, who have voted to form unions at only a handful of charters. Perhaps as a result, teachers\u2019 unions have often opposed charter schools. They say that these schools compete unfairly with traditional public schools and are not held to the same standards.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Measuring the effectiveness of any school is challenging. Parents choose their children\u2019s schools, either by living in a certain school district or by applying to a private or charter school. Some schools are filled with students who would perform well in almost any setting. This could mislead us into thinking these schools provide an exemplary education, when the truth is they attract strong students.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This is called selection bias, the greatest challenge in evaluating the effectiveness of schools. Stuyvesant High School in New York City, to which entry is granted through a competitive exam, is filled with smart students who might succeed anywhere. When those students do well, is it because of the school or the students or both?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the case of charter schools, researchers have found an innovative way to overcome selection bias: analyzing the admission lotteries that charters are required to run when they have more applicants than seats. Each lottery serves as a randomized trial... Random assignment lets us compare apples to apples: Lottery winners and losers are identical, on average, when they apply. Any differences that emerge after the lottery can safely be attributed to charter attendance.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">One concern with this approach is that charters might push out difficult students after the lottery. News accounts indicate that some schools have engaged in this practice, including a high-performing charter school in New York City.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">That\u2019s one reason the lottery studies don\u2019t compare students who are and are not enrolled in charter schools, but instead compare students who win and lose the lotteries. If a student wins a lottery but declines to attend, or transfers out, her test scores are still assigned to the charter for the analysis. This means that the estimates are not biased by transfers after the lottery takes place\u2026.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">A consistent pattern has emerged from this research. In urban areas, where students are overwhelmingly low-achieving, poor and nonwhite, charter schools tend to do better than other public schools in improving student achievement. By contrast, outside of urban areas, where students tend to be white and middle class, charters do no better and sometimes do worse than public schools.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This pattern holds in lottery studies in Massachusetts as well in a national study of charter schools funded by the Education Department. Boston\u2019s charters also do a better job at preparing students for college\u2026 \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Not all charters are successful, of course, but we should not expect them to be. Charters are a place for educators to try out new methods\u2026 It\u2019s the job of government to distinguish between the successful charters and the failures, and to shut down the failures.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1911"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu17":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The author ascribes the reason for teacher&rsquo;s unions to oppose charter schools to <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>the autonomy of charter schools in hiring and firing teachers.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>the absence of teachers\u2019 unions in all but a few charter schools.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>the unfair nature of competition between charter schools and public schools.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>All of the above.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","CORRECT_ANSWER":"a","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"6157","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>6<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>1<\/i><i>:<\/i><i> <\/i>The passage given below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

But are they good for education?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Rigorous research suggests that the answer is yes for an important, underserved group: low-income, nonwhite students in urban areas. These children tend to do better if enrolled in charter schools instead of traditional public schools.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">There are exceptions, of course. We can\u2019t predict with certainty that a particular child will do better in a specific charter or traditional public school. Social scientists can confirm only whether, on average, a given treatment is beneficial for a given population. Not all charter schools are outstanding: In the suburbs, for example, the evidence is that they do no better than traditional public schools. But they have been shown to improve the education of disadvantaged children at scale, in multiple cities, over many years.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Charter schools are publicly funded but not bound by many of the rules that constrain traditional public schools. Charters, for example, can easily try new curriculums or teaching strategies, or choose to have a longer school day. They have more autonomy than traditional public schools in hiring and firing teachers, who have voted to form unions at only a handful of charters. Perhaps as a result, teachers\u2019 unions have often opposed charter schools. They say that these schools compete unfairly with traditional public schools and are not held to the same standards.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Measuring the effectiveness of any school is challenging. Parents choose their children\u2019s schools, either by living in a certain school district or by applying to a private or charter school. Some schools are filled with students who would perform well in almost any setting. This could mislead us into thinking these schools provide an exemplary education, when the truth is they attract strong students.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This is called selection bias, the greatest challenge in evaluating the effectiveness of schools. Stuyvesant High School in New York City, to which entry is granted through a competitive exam, is filled with smart students who might succeed anywhere. When those students do well, is it because of the school or the students or both?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the case of charter schools, researchers have found an innovative way to overcome selection bias: analyzing the admission lotteries that charters are required to run when they have more applicants than seats. Each lottery serves as a randomized trial... Random assignment lets us compare apples to apples: Lottery winners and losers are identical, on average, when they apply. Any differences that emerge after the lottery can safely be attributed to charter attendance.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">One concern with this approach is that charters might push out difficult students after the lottery. News accounts indicate that some schools have engaged in this practice, including a high-performing charter school in New York City.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">That\u2019s one reason the lottery studies don\u2019t compare students who are and are not enrolled in charter schools, but instead compare students who win and lose the lotteries. If a student wins a lottery but declines to attend, or transfers out, her test scores are still assigned to the charter for the analysis. This means that the estimates are not biased by transfers after the lottery takes place\u2026.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">A consistent pattern has emerged from this research.

People with low imagination communicate mainly regarding subjects that are handed to them by external sources.

If they manage to engage, they often turn sharply towards derailment of the dialogue, and bring about a good degree of resentment, ill will and unwanted conclusions.
