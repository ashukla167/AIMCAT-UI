Earlier this month the Parisian home of a 78-year-old Jewish community leader was attacked by intruders who shouted: &ldquo;You are Jews, where is the money?&rdquo; Along with his wife and son, the man was taken hostage, beaten and robbed, in what the government acknowledged was &ldquo;an act &hellip;directly related to their religion&rdquo;. Around the same time, the former head of a school in Marseille made waves by saying that when he was in charge he would advise Jews against enrolling, for fear of harassment. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Meanwhile the Vatican recently co-organised a symposium in Rome on anti-Semitism and minority rights in the Middle East, at which Tony Blair declared: &ldquo;There is anti-Semitism in the East, but also in the West. There are manifestations in European countries, and also in the United Kingdom.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So how bad are things in Mr Blair&rsquo;s homeland? On the face of things, Britain is a relatively good place to be Jewish. When anti-Semitic feelings across Europe are compared, the UK tends to do well. But a new study by the London-based Institute for Jewish Policy Research gives an unusually nuanced picture of opinion in Britain. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It found that hard-core anti-Semites, who &ldquo;express multiple anti-Semitic attitudes readily and confidently&rdquo;, amounted to 2.4% of the population, while a further 3% could be described as &ldquo;softer&rdquo; anti-Semites, expressing somewhat fewer negative views. To probe their opinions, respondents were invited to react to propositions like &ldquo;Jews think they are better than other people&rdquo; or &ldquo;The interests of Jews in Britain are different from&hellip;.the rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jews have too much power in Britain&hellip;&rdquo; Besides these, the study said that there was a &ldquo;much larger number of people who believe a small number of negative ideas about Jews but&hellip;may not be consciously hostile or prejudiced towards them&rdquo;. It found that 15% of Britons agreed at least in part to two or more anti-Semitic propositions, with a further 15% agreeing at least in part to one of them. The researchers&rsquo; interpretation was cautious: <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<img alt=\"\"

also tackled the sensitive question of how far hostility towards Jews is linked with negative feelings towards Israel. It found the two mind-sets to be correlated, but not co-extensive. Thus 86% of those British people who hold no anti-Israel attitudes hold no anti-Semitic views either; but among those who hold a large number of anti-Israel attitudes, only 26% are completely free of anti-Semitic feelings. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Still, there clearly are people who are strongly critical of Israel, but not anti-Jewish, and a somewhat smaller contingent who harbour anti-Semitic sentiments but have no particular gripe with the Jewish state.

Earlier this month the Parisian home of a 78-year-old Jewish community leader was attacked by intruders who shouted: &ldquo;You are Jews, where is the money?&rdquo; Along with his wife and son, the man was taken hostage, beaten and robbed, in what the government acknowledged was &ldquo;an act &hellip;directly related to their religion&rdquo;. Around the same time, the former head of a school in Marseille made waves by saying that when he was in charge he would advise Jews against enrolling, for fear of harassment. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Meanwhile the Vatican recently co-organised a symposium in Rome on anti-Semitism and minority rights in the Middle East, at which Tony Blair declared: &ldquo;There is anti-Semitism in the East, but also in the West. There are manifestations in European countries, and also in the United Kingdom.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So how bad are things in Mr Blair&rsquo;s homeland? On the face of things, Britain is a relatively good place to be Jewish. When anti-Semitic feelings across Europe are compared, the UK tends to do well. But a new study by the London-based Institute for Jewish Policy Research gives an unusually nuanced picture of opinion in Britain. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It found that hard-core anti-Semites, who &ldquo;express multiple anti-Semitic attitudes readily and confidently&rdquo;, amounted to 2.4% of the population, while a further 3% could be described as &ldquo;softer&rdquo; anti-Semites, expressing somewhat fewer negative views. To probe their opinions, respondents were invited to react to propositions like &ldquo;Jews think they are better than other people&rdquo; or &ldquo;The interests of Jews in Britain are different from&hellip;.the rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jews have too much power in Britain&hellip;&rdquo; Besides these, the study said that there was a &ldquo;much larger number of people who believe a small number of negative ideas about Jews but&hellip;may not be consciously hostile or prejudiced towards them&rdquo;.

Earlier this month the Parisian home of a 78-year-old Jewish community leader was attacked by intruders who shouted: &ldquo;You are Jews, where is the money?&rdquo; Along with his wife and son, the man was taken hostage, beaten and robbed, in what the government acknowledged was &ldquo;an act &hellip;directly related to their religion&rdquo;. Around the same time, the former head of a school in Marseille made waves by saying that when he was in charge he would advise Jews against enrolling, for fear of harassment. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Meanwhile the Vatican recently co-organised a symposium in Rome on anti-Semitism and minority rights in the Middle East, at which Tony Blair declared: &ldquo;There is anti-Semitism in the East, but also in the West. There are manifestations in European countries, and also in the United Kingdom.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So how bad are things in Mr Blair&rsquo;s homeland? On the face of things, Britain is a relatively good place to be Jewish. When anti-Semitic feelings across Europe are compared, the UK tends to do well. But a new study by the London-based Institute for Jewish Policy Research gives an unusually nuanced picture of opinion in Britain. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It found that hard-core anti-Semites, who &ldquo;express multiple anti-Semitic attitudes readily and confidently&rdquo;, amounted to 2.4% of the population, while a further 3% could be described as &ldquo;softer&rdquo; anti-Semites, expressing somewhat fewer negative views. To probe their opinions, respondents were invited to react to propositions like &ldquo;Jews think they are better than other people&rdquo; or &ldquo;The interests of Jews in Britain are different from&hellip;.the rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jews have too much power in Britain&hellip;&rdquo; Besides these, the study said that there was a &ldquo;much larger number of people who believe a small number of negative ideas about Jews but&hellip;may not be consciously hostile or prejudiced towards them&rdquo;.

Earlier this month the Parisian home of a 78-year-old Jewish community leader was attacked by intruders who shouted: &ldquo;You are Jews, where is the money?&rdquo; Along with his wife and son, the man was taken hostage, beaten and robbed, in what the government acknowledged was &ldquo;an act &hellip;directly related to their religion&rdquo;. Around the same time, the former head of a school in Marseille made waves by saying that when he was in charge he would advise Jews against enrolling, for fear of harassment. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Meanwhile the Vatican recently co-organised a symposium in Rome on anti-Semitism and minority rights in the Middle East, at which Tony Blair declared: &ldquo;There is anti-Semitism in the East, but also in the West. There are manifestations in European countries, and also in the United Kingdom.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So how bad are things in Mr Blair&rsquo;s homeland? On the face of things, Britain is a relatively good place to be Jewish. When anti-Semitic feelings across Europe are compared, the UK tends to do well. But a new study by the London-based Institute for Jewish Policy Research gives an unusually nuanced picture of opinion in Britain. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It found that hard-core anti-Semites, who &ldquo;express multiple anti-Semitic attitudes readily and confidently&rdquo;, amounted to 2.4% of the population, while a further 3% could be described as &ldquo;softer&rdquo; anti-Semites, expressing somewhat fewer negative views. To probe their opinions, respondents were invited to react to propositions like &ldquo;Jews think they are better than other people&rdquo; or &ldquo;The interests of Jews in Britain are different from&hellip;.the rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jews have too much power in Britain&hellip;&rdquo; Besides these, the study said that there was a &ldquo;much larger number of people who believe a small number of negative ideas about Jews but&hellip;may not be consciously hostile or prejudiced towards them&rdquo;.

Earlier this month the Parisian home of a 78-year-old Jewish community leader was attacked by intruders who shouted: &ldquo;You are Jews, where is the money?&rdquo; Along with his wife and son, the man was taken hostage, beaten and robbed, in what the government acknowledged was &ldquo;an act &hellip;directly related to their religion&rdquo;. Around the same time, the former head of a school in Marseille made waves by saying that when he was in charge he would advise Jews against enrolling, for fear of harassment. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Meanwhile the Vatican recently co-organised a symposium in Rome on anti-Semitism and minority rights in the Middle East, at which Tony Blair declared: &ldquo;There is anti-Semitism in the East, but also in the West. There are manifestations in European countries, and also in the United Kingdom.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So how bad are things in Mr Blair&rsquo;s homeland? On the face of things, Britain is a relatively good place to be Jewish. When anti-Semitic feelings across Europe are compared, the UK tends to do well. But a new study by the London-based Institute for Jewish Policy Research gives an unusually nuanced picture of opinion in Britain. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It found that hard-core anti-Semites, who &ldquo;express multiple anti-Semitic attitudes readily and confidently&rdquo;, amounted to 2.4% of the population, while a further 3% could be described as &ldquo;softer&rdquo; anti-Semites, expressing somewhat fewer negative views. To probe their opinions, respondents were invited to react to propositions like &ldquo;Jews think they are better than other people&rdquo; or &ldquo;The interests of Jews in Britain are different from&hellip;.the rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jews have too much power in Britain&hellip;&rdquo; Besides these, the study said that there was a &ldquo;much larger number of people who believe a small number of negative ideas about Jews but&hellip;may not be consciously hostile or prejudiced towards them&rdquo;.

Earlier this month the Parisian home of a 78-year-old Jewish community leader was attacked by intruders who shouted: &ldquo;You are Jews, where is the money?&rdquo; Along with his wife and son, the man was taken hostage, beaten and robbed, in what the government acknowledged was &ldquo;an act &hellip;directly related to their religion&rdquo;. Around the same time, the former head of a school in Marseille made waves by saying that when he was in charge he would advise Jews against enrolling, for fear of harassment. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Meanwhile the Vatican recently co-organised a symposium in Rome on anti-Semitism and minority rights in the Middle East, at which Tony Blair declared: &ldquo;There is anti-Semitism in the East, but also in the West. There are manifestations in European countries, and also in the United Kingdom.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So how bad are things in Mr Blair&rsquo;s homeland? On the face of things, Britain is a relatively good place to be Jewish. When anti-Semitic feelings across Europe are compared, the UK tends to do well. But a new study by the London-based Institute for Jewish Policy Research gives an unusually nuanced picture of opinion in Britain. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It found that hard-core anti-Semites, who &ldquo;express multiple anti-Semitic attitudes readily and confidently&rdquo;, amounted to 2.4% of the population, while a further 3% could be described as &ldquo;softer&rdquo; anti-Semites, expressing somewhat fewer negative views. To probe their opinions, respondents were invited to react to propositions like &ldquo;Jews think they are better than other people&rdquo; or &ldquo;The interests of Jews in Britain are different from&hellip;.the rest&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jews have too much power in Britain&hellip;&rdquo; Besides these, the study said that there was a &ldquo;much larger number of people who believe a small number of negative ideas about Jews but&hellip;may not be consciously hostile or prejudiced towards them&rdquo;.

In the musical field, improvisation is the art of composing and recording in the same time; in other words, it is inventing in that time. The improvisation theory draws together musicians, musicologists, philosophers, historians, and cultural theorists to consider questions of how and why improvisation as both a musical and social practice contributes to social organization overall. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Another developing area is the ethics of improvisation. Tracey Nicholls argues that the examination and adoption of the norms and values that flourish in communities of improvising musicians - those who improvise in the &ldquo;free jazz&rdquo; tradition, in particular - can help us to build more responsive, more democratic political societies. To be part of an improvising ensemble demands an openness to others, a willingness to listen carefully, closely, and charitably, and to respond in constructive ways that advance the musical &ldquo;conversation.&rdquo; This requires capacities for self-trust and respect for others on the part of every participant. The payoff is an expanded ability to engage differences creatively, instead of through an attitude of fear and hostility, and this in turn leads to a greater ability to deal with the complexity of a fast paced, globalized world. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The ideal actor, in both musical improvisation and the sphere of grassroots popular political action, is the figure Cornel West dubs &ldquo;the jazz freedom fighter&rdquo;. To be a jazz freedom fighter is to attempt to galvanize and energize world-weary people into forms of organization with accountable leadership that promote critical exchange and broad reflection. The interplay of individuality and unity is not one of uniformity and unanimity imposed from above but rather of conflict among diverse groupings that reach a dynamic consensus subject to questioning and criticism. &ldquo;As with a soloist in a jazz quartet, quintet or band, individuality is promoted in order to sustain and increase the creative tension with the group&nbsp;<\/font><\/font><\/span>&minus;&nbsp;<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">a tension that yields higher levels of performance to achieve the aim of the collective project,&rdquo; West says. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In developing our capacities for openness to difference and living with risk (that, for instance, our attempts to negotiate and communicate might fail), this ethics of improvisation grounds subsidiary virtues that are not otherwise encouraged by our social <i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>o<\/i>.

But there are at least two reasons why this doesn\u2019t seem like a compelling answer to the question, even if you are morally good. The first is that, though being a good person would explain why you wouldn\u2019t actually do this, it doesn\u2019t seem to explain why you wouldn\u2019t have been able to come up with this as a solution in the first place. After all, your good moral character doesn\u2019t stop you from admitting that it is a way of getting to the airport, even if you wouldn\u2019t go through with it. And the second reason is that it seems equally likely that you wouldn\u2019t have come up with this possibility for someone else in the same situation - even someone whom you didn\u2019t know was morally good. So what does explain why we don\u2019t consider the possibility of taking a taxi but not paying?

In these studies, participants were asked to read short stories about people facing a series of problems (such as a car breaking down on the way to the airport). They were then asked to make judgments about what would be possible or impossible for a person to do in that situation. The critical manipulation was that half of the participants were asked to make judgments very quickly, in about one second, which prevented them from having time to reflect, and forced them to rely on their default way of thinking about what was possible. The other half were asked to reflect before deciding whether something was possible. Then both groups were asked about a set of different possibilities, some of which were completely ordinary (like taking a taxi), and others of which were immoral (like taking a taxi without paying).\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We then examined participants\u2019 responses to figure out how their judgments of what was possible changed when they had to answer quickly compared with when they had time to reflect before answering. For the ordinary actions, there was no real difference: naturally, people judged ordinary actions to be possible whether they answered quickly or had time to reflect. There was a striking difference, however, for immoral actions. When participants reflected before answering, they typically judged that it <i>w<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i>possible for someone to do these immoral actions. In contrast, when they had to answer quickly, participants judged that it was actually impossible to pursue these solutions almost 40% of the time. This suggests that before they had time to really think about it, they weren\u2019t actually thinking of many of these actions as even possible. We also compared these actions with ones that were <i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>y<\/i><i> <\/i>improbable but not immoral and found that this kind of effect was specific to the immoral actions, so it\u2019s not something that can be explained by probability alone.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Once one begins to see the central thesis that these studies suggest, it\u2019s not hard to notice that this way of thinking pervades many aspects of our lives.

Zen demands an overcoming of this paradigm by practically achieving a holistic perspective in cognition, so that the Zen practitioner can celebrate, with a stillness of mind, a life of tending toward the concrete thing-events of everyday life and nature. ... Generally speaking, Zen cherishes simplicity and straightforwardness in grasping reality and acting on it &ldquo;here and now,&rdquo; for it believes that a thing-event that is immediately presenc<i>i<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>g<\/i><i> <\/i>before one&rsquo;s eyes or under one&rsquo;s foot is no other than an expression of suchness, i.e., it <i>i<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i>such <i>t<\/i><i>h<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>t<\/i><i> <\/i>it is showing its primordial mode of be<i>i<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>g<\/i>. It also understands a specificity of thing-event to be a recapitulation of the whole; parts and the whole are to be lived in an inseparable relationship.

Intrinsic motivation is the self-desire to seek out new things and new challenges, to analyze one's capacity, to observe and to gain knowledge. It is driven by an interest, curiosity or enjoyment in the task itself, and exists within the individual rather than relying on external pressures or a desire for reward. Intrinsic motivation helps one engage in the task willingly as well as helps one to work at improving one's skills, which will increase one's capabilities. Extrinsic motivation refers to the performance of an activity in order to attain a desired outcome and it is the opposite of intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation comes from influences outside of the individual. In extrinsic motivation, the harder question to answer is where do people get the motivation to carry out and continue to push with persistence. Usually extrinsic motivation is used to attain outcomes that a person wouldn't get from intrinsic motivation. Common extrinsic motivations are competition and rewards (for example money or grades) for showing the desired behavior, and the threat of punishment following misbehavior.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>People who are intrinsically motivated do not desire rewards or threats as their motivation exists within themselves.
