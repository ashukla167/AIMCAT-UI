But in 2015, Martin Franklin, the head teacher, introduced a hawklike data-based monitoring system. Parents receive a colour-coded memo every two months, showing their child\u2019s progress towards various goals, as well as their attendance. Pupils who do well are rewarded with gift tokens. Exam results are on the up.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The outlook for Welsh education as a whole is, however, less sunny. Many date the country\u2019s difficulties back to changes made after the devolution of some political powers, including control of all education policy bar teachers\u2019 pay, from Westminster, London to Cardiff, Wales in 1999. At the time, Welsh education was set up in a broadly similar way to that in England. But, in 2001, a Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition scrapped school league tables. They placed an unnecessary burden on schools, the education minister explained. And, in 2004, a Labour government abolished national tests for 11- and 14-year-olds.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Standards duly plummeted. Getting rid of league tables alone cost the average pupil two grades at GCSE, the exams taken at 16, according to research by Simon Burgess of the University of Bristol. Yet it was not until Wales entered the OECD\u2019s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) in 2006 that the extent of the decline became clear. The results of Welsh 15-year-olds were similar to those of their peers in Latvia and the Czech Republic, and far below those in England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Few disagree that Welsh schools are in serious need of improvement. Much of the past ten years has been spent trying to catch up with the rest of Britain. Changes include moving some training and administrative support from small local authorities to new regional organisations, and channelling more funding and help to the weakest schools, including Morriston. In 2013, new literacy and numeracy tests began. In 2015, a school-categorisation system vaguely akin to league tables was brought back.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Still, few had much hope that enough had changed to improve performance in the latest round of PISA tests, whose results were released last year. Sure enough, Wales was still far behind Finland, Singapore and Japan, where students have always and continue to ace the test. Discussion of poor PISA performance dominated a recent head teachers\u2019 conference, says Mr Franklin. The OECD has warned of \u201creform fatigue\u201d.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">PISA has its opponents but not in Wales. Some say that it encourages countries to engage in short-term fixes as they deal with a narrow curriculum and too standardised a testing process to climb the rankings. Others complain that it is not right to compare systems using average scores from random schools, and also add that cultural differences make the tests unfair.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">What next? A new Labour-Liberal Democrat government in Wales, formed last year, has grand plans. First, it hopes to improve the quality of teaching. A recent report by Estyn, the Welsh schools inspectorate, drily noted that \u201cteaching is one of the weakest aspects of [education] provision.\u201d The government wants trainee teachers to spend more time in the classroom and less in the lecture hall, and will introduce new professional standards that emphasize their duty to keep improving once they gain accreditation. \u201cThe biggest learner in the classroom should be the teacher,\u201d chirps Kirsty Williams, the Lib Dem education secretary.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Second, a new curriculum will be introduced in 2018. It will seek to break down subject boundaries, free teachers to teach how they see fit and subject schools to lighter monitoring. Ms Williams flags the example of Finland which does not idolize highly stressful school systems and Canada, which, like Wales, has a bilingual education system, and runs excellent schools.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Yet there is another, less promising forerunner. Scotland recently adopted a more open-ended curriculum, with little success. Although it once had one of the best education systems in the world, Scotland\u2019s PISA results have been on a downward trend, which accelerated in the most recent round. Many blame its \u201cCurriculum for Excellence\u201d, which was phased in from 2010, and on which the proposed new Welsh curriculum is based.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Despite supposedly having been given more freedom, teachers in Scotland complain that they are overwhelmed by the number of outcomes they must show they are meeting and complain that they have little time to spend on the basics. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Ms Williams argues that Wales already has a strong focus on basic standards, and that it will develop an assessment system that is careful not to overwork teachers. But Scotland provides a lesson worth heeding. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

His work with fractured communities emphasizes the restoration of voice, a concept he finds particularly resonant with people who are struggling to repair their violent communities. What \u201cvoice\u201d - understood both as the individual regaining his or her voice, and the community engaging in meaningful conversation - requires is \u201ca container or space within which people [feel] safe but [are] also close enough to hear and receive the echo of each other\u2019s voices\u201d.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The particular metaphor Lederach favours in his representations of peace processes is one that brings together voice and container: the Tibetan singing bowl. He observes that social healing, like musical resonance, emerges from the interaction of many vibrations, individual and collective, held within a community context. Social healing and reconciliation emerge in and around the container that holds collective processes. ...  The first distinguishing characteristic that the bowl shares with sound is circular movement: \u201c[g]oing in circles and repeating them over and again is not,\u201d he insists, \u201c\u2026 a movement of going nowhere,\u201d but has instead \u201ca ritualistic quality \u2026 creating a certain kind of space and moment\u201d. The second is the container itself: \u201cthe bowl creates the space or location from which the sound is coaxed and held, but in terms of movement the sensation is one of going deep, made possible by the circling\u201d. \u201cDeepening becomes a directional focus of the container,\u201d says Lederach. The third directional characteristic that makes the bowl a compelling metaphor is rising: \u201c[s]ound not only seems to rise from the bowl,\u201d he explains; \u201cit expands, moves out, touches and surrounds the space within its reach. Sound moves in all directions and offers the experience of \u201cfeelings of being touched and held\u201d.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Circling, deepening, and rising are all aspects of percussion that make instruments like drums and the singing bowl often function as \u201cthe heartbeat\u201d of musical performances. They are also important aspects of the genuine, voluntary, non-imposed community reconciliation that Lederach prefers to discuss as \u201cconflict transformation.\u201d Going around, repeating over and over, is a way of gathering grassroots support within a community; each time an outreach effort is made, space is created for community members who had previously not been involved to join the movement. The descending movement can be understood as a way of describing the process of developing, through a repetition that may well become ritualized, an emotional loyalty to something that starts out as a social commitment - internalizing the peace-building ambition. And the rising movement can similarly be understood as the inexorable pressure that a fully committed, mobilized grassroots community can exert on a wider population - regional, national, or international. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

The descending movement can be understood as a way of describing the process of developing, through a repetition that may well become ritualized, an emotional loyalty to something that starts out as a social commitment - internalizing the peace-building ambition.

Technological backwardness was no impediment; we know from Rwanda and Cambodia that massive numbers of people can be murdered with low-tech means like machetes and starvation.

The enduring moral trend of the century was a violence-averse humanism that originated in the Enlightenment, became overshadowed by counter-Enlightenment ideologies wedded to agents of growing destructive power and regained momentum in the wake of World War II. .... However, we are aware of the cliche \u201cThe twentieth century was the bloodiest in history\u201d that has been used to indict a vast range of demons, including atheism, science, capitalism, communism etc. But is this true? The claim is rarely backed up by death tolls from any century other than the 20<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup><sup>.<\/sup><sup> <\/sup>.... The 20<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup> century also had more people. The population of the world in 1950 was 2.5 billion, which is about two and a half times the population in 1800, four and a half times that in 1600, seven times that in 1300, and fifteen times that of 1 CE. So, the death count of a war in 1600 would have to be multiplied by 4.5 for us to compare its destructiveness to the destructiveness of a war in the middle of the 20<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup> century.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Another illusion is historical myopia: the closer an era is to our vantage point in the present, the more details of the same can be gathered. Historical myopia can afflict both common sense and professional history. The cognitive psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman have shown that people intuitively estimate relative frequency using a shortcut called the availability heuristic: the easier it is to recall examples of an event, the more probable people think it is. People  overestimate the likelihoods of the kinds of accidents that make headlines, such as plane crashes, shark attacks, and terrorist bombings, and they underestimate those that pile up unremarked, like electrocutions, falls and drownings. ..... In a survey of historical memory, I asked a hundred internet users to write down as many wars as they could remember in five minutes. The responses were heavily weighted towards the world wars, wars fought by the US, and wars close to the present. Though the earlier centuries, had far more wars, people remembered more wars from the recent centuries.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">When one corrects for the availability bias and the 20<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup> century population explosion, one comes across many wars and massacres that could hold their head high among 20th-century atrocities.  Taking into account population differences with past societies, Steven Pinker develops an \u201cadjusted rank\u201d with adjusted death tolls based on a \u201cmid-20th- century equivalent\u201d to come up with a new ranking for atrocities. The new ranking list includes not just deaths on the battlefield but indirect deaths of civilians from starvation and disease. The death toll is thus considerably higher than estimates of battlefield casualties for both recent and ancient events.  \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Had you even heard of all of the great atrocities from time immemorial? I hadn\"t. Did you know there were five wars and four atrocities before World War I that killed more people than that war? I suspect many readers will also be surprised to learn that of the 21 worst things that people have ever done to each other, fourteen were in centuries before the 20<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup>. And all of this pertains to absolute numbers. When you scale by population size, only one of the 20<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup> century\"s atrocities even makes the top ten. The worst atrocity of all time was the Lushan Revolt and Civil War that began in 755 AD, an 8 year rebellion during China\"s Tang Dynasty that, according to censuses, resulted in the loss of two-thirds of the empire\"s population, a sixth of the world\"s population at the time.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">These figures, of course, cannot all be taken at face value. Some tendentiously blame the entire death toll of a famine or epidemic on a particular war, rebellion, or tyrant. And some came from innumerable cultures that lacked modern techniques for counting and record-keeping. At the same time, narrative history confirms that earlier civilizations were certainly capable of killing in vast numbers. Technological backwardness was no impediment; we know from Rwanda and Cambodia that massive numbers of people can be murdered with low-tech means like machetes and starvation. And in the distant past, implements of killing were not always so low-tech, because military weaponry usually boasted the most advanced technology of the age. The military historian John Keegan notes that by the middle of the 2<sup>n<\/sup><sup>d<\/sup> millennium BCE, the chariot allowed nomadic armies to rain death on the civilizations they invaded. \u201cCircling at a distance of 100 or 200 yards from the herds of unarmoured foot soldiers, a chariot crew - one to drive, one to shoot - might have transfixed six men a minute.\u201d\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

Today, lots of companies try to turn their cards into miniature plugs for their products. That business cards are thriving in a digital age is a forceful reminder that there is much about business that is timeless. Take, for instance, the eternal and inescapable question of whether you can trust someone. The number of things that machines can do better than humans grows by the day. But they cannot look people in the eye and decide what sort of person they are. And they cannot transform acquaintanceships into relationships. A good deal of business life will always be about social bonds - having dinner with people and playing sport with them. ___________________________\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",
