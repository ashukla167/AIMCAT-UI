Irish voters chose by a 66:34 majority to repeal a constitutional amendment restricting abortion. As a result, attention is now turning to the situation in Northern Ireland, where abortion remains illegal unless the risk to the mother\u2019s health is severe. The region has resolutely declined to adopt the more liberal approach to abortion seen in the rest of the United Kingdom.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The Abortion Act was passed in the United Kingdom in 1967, allowing doctors to perform abortions so long as certain conditions had been met. But the law in Northern Ireland was not changed, and remained as it had since Victorian times. The region\u2019s devolved legislature was dominated by the Ulster Unionist Party, which in an unusual alliance with the Catholic church firmly opposed the legalisation of abortion. In subsequent years, Protestant and Catholic churches in Northern Ireland quietly co-operated to oppose moves to update the law, with the late Ian Paisley, founder of both the Free Presbyterian church and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), leading the way. As a result thousands of Northern Irish women have ended up travelling to England to terminate pregnancies. In one recent 14-year period the numbers crossing the Irish Sea exceeded 800 every year. Although this exodus was no secret, it was generally mentioned in whispers. \u201cShe got the boat,\u201d was the phrase often used. Awareness of this situation in the rest of the UK was limited. Politicians in Belfast preferred not to broadcast the arrangement, which women\u2019s groups and other campaigners increasingly denounced as the exporting of misery.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">When the Northern Ireland Assembly came into being in 1998, its powers included the right to legislate on abortion. In the last few years it has seen a number of debates on the subject, in an effort to introduce a new law. But the DUP has always had the votes to defeat all pro-abortion motions. The party has a powerful fundamentalist Protestant element in its ranks and especially within its leadership. Opinion polls indicate, however, that the views of the party\u2019s supporters are more liberal. And in the aftermath of the Irish referendum result, the clamour for change is likely to grow. Indeed, across the Irish Sea, pressure to support liberalisation in Northern Ireland has been building within the major Westminster-based parties. Penny Mordaunt, minister for women and equality, described the result as \u201ca historic and great day for Ireland and a hopeful one for Northern Ireland.\u201d An education minister, Anne Milton, and the former equality minister, Justine Greening, also voiced their support.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, was quick to say that the Dublin result \u201chas no impact\u201d on the law in Northern Ireland. She said she disapproved of activists in the Republic \u201ctaking to the streets in celebration.\u201d Although support for reform appears to be growing at Westminster, a complication for Theresa May is the leverage that Mrs Foster and her party have over the Tory administration. In return for additional spending in Northern Ireland the DUP\u2019s ten MPs provide valuable support for Mrs May in Brexit votes.

Irish voters chose by a 66:34 majority to repeal a constitutional amendment restricting abortion. As a result, attention is now turning to the situation in Northern Ireland, where abortion remains illegal unless the risk to the mother\u2019s health is severe. The region has resolutely declined to adopt the more liberal approach to abortion seen in the rest of the United Kingdom.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The Abortion Act was passed in the United Kingdom in 1967, allowing doctors to perform abortions so long as certain conditions had been met. But the law in Northern Ireland was not changed, and remained as it had since Victorian times. The region\u2019s devolved legislature was dominated by the Ulster Unionist Party, which in an unusual alliance with the Catholic church firmly opposed the legalisation of abortion. In subsequent years, Protestant and Catholic churches in Northern Ireland quietly co-operated to oppose moves to update the law, with the late Ian Paisley, founder of both the Free Presbyterian church and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), leading the way. As a result thousands of Northern Irish women have ended up travelling to England to terminate pregnancies. In one recent 14-year period the numbers crossing the Irish Sea exceeded 800 every year. Although this exodus was no secret, it was generally mentioned in whispers. \u201cShe got the boat,\u201d was the phrase often used. Awareness of this situation in the rest of the UK was limited. Politicians in Belfast preferred not to broadcast the arrangement, which women\u2019s groups and other campaigners increasingly denounced as the exporting of misery.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">When the Northern Ireland Assembly came into being in 1998, its powers included the right to legislate on abortion. In the last few years it has seen a number of debates on the subject, in an effort to introduce a new law. But the DUP has always had the votes to defeat all pro-abortion motions. The party has a powerful fundamentalist Protestant element in its ranks and especially within its leadership. Opinion polls indicate, however, that the views of the party\u2019s supporters are more liberal. And in the aftermath of the Irish referendum result, the clamour for change is likely to grow. Indeed, across the Irish Sea, pressure to support liberalisation in Northern Ireland has been building within the major Westminster-based parties. Penny Mordaunt, minister for women and equality, described the result as \u201ca historic and great day for Ireland and a hopeful one for Northern Ireland.\u201d An education minister, Anne Milton, and the former equality minister, Justine Greening, also voiced their support.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The DUP leader, Arlene Foster, was quick to say that the Dublin result \u201chas no impact\u201d on the law in Northern Ireland. She said she disapproved of activists in the Republic \u201ctaking to the streets in celebration.\u201d Although support for reform appears to be growing at Westminster, a complication for Theresa May is the leverage that Mrs Foster and her party have over the Tory administration.

Socialists, of whom there were many millions by 1914, would not have supported a belligerent foreign policy, and could only be relied upon to fight in a defensive war.

This so-called \u2018war guilt ruling\u2019 set the tone for the long debate that followed on the causes of the war. From 1919 onwards, governments and historians engaged with this question as revisionists (who wanted to revise the verdict of Versailles) clashed with anti-revisionists who agreed with the victors\u2019 assessment. Sponsored by post-war governments and with access to vast amounts of documents, revisionist historians set about proving that the victors at Versailles had been wrong.

To use another metaphor, although words may be the midwives of ideas, their true parents are experience and reason. Leibniz suggested the same model, writing that \u201clanguages are the best mirrors of the human mind.\u201d\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Locke\u2019s emphasis on individual words, as well as the foundational role he assigned to psychology, were attacked by the German logician Gottlob Frege (1848-1925). The fundamental notion of this theory is that the meaning of a sentence - the \u201cthought\u201d it expresses - is a function of its structure, or syntax. The thought, in turn, is determined not by the psychological state of the speaker or hearer - thoughts are not \u201cmental\u201d entities  - but by the logical inferences the sentence permits. Sentence meaning, furthermore, is prior to word meaning, in the sense that the meanings of individual words are determined only by what they contribute to the thoughts expressed by the sentences in which the words appear. Frege\u2019s theory of sentence meaning explains how it is possible for different people to grasp the same thought<i> <\/i>though no two people associate the corresponding sentence with exactly the same ideas, images, or other mental experiences.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">An enormously influential element of Frege\u2019s theory of meaning was his distinction between the referent of an expression - the thing it refers to - and its sense. The sense of an expression is both its contribution to the thought expressed by the sentence and the \u201cmode of presentation\u201d of its referent. By means of this distinction, Frege was able to show how there can be informative statements of identity. The sentence \u201c<i>E<\/i><i>v<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i> <\/i><i>i<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>C<\/i><i>h<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>g<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>\u201d<\/i> is informative - it may even represent a geographic discovery - whereas the sentence \u201c<i>E<\/i><i>v<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i> <\/i><i>i<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>E<\/i><i>v<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>\u201d<\/i><i> <\/i>is not. Yet they appear to have the same meaning - both seem to say, of one and the same mountain, that it is identical to itself. How, then, can one sentence be informative and the other trivial? Frege\u2019s answer is that \u201c<i>E<\/i><i>v<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>\u201d<\/i><i> <\/i>and \u201c<i>C<\/i><i>h<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>g<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>\u201d<\/i><i> <\/i>(the Tibetan name) \u201cpresent\u201d the mountain in different ways.  <b>\n<\/b><\/font><b>\n<\/b><\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In Frege\u2019s logic, sentences and singular terms are \u201ccomplete\u201d or \u201csaturated\u201d expressions, and predicates are incomplete or unsaturated expressions.

Sentence meaning, furthermore, is prior to word meaning, in the sense that the meanings of individual words are determined only by what they contribute to the thoughts expressed by the sentences in which the words appear.

For example, when a person contemplates a radical change in life - going to live alone in the moors of Galway perhaps, or to a 10-day silent Buddhist retreat - the more he or she yearns for it, the more he or she fears the moment of change.

More mortifying are solutions involving ritual prayer, rosaries, or mantras which feel like a full-scale assault on the self, with acoustic weapons.

If perception of sound depends on our state of mind, then conversely a state of mind can hardly exist without an external world with which it is in relation and that conditions it - either our present environment, or some past event that echoes in our minds. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Silence, then, is always relative. Our experience of it is more interesting than the acoustic effect itself. And the most interesting kind of silence is that of a mind free of words,<i> <\/i>free of thoughts, free of language, a mental silence. When we have a perception of being tormented by noise, a lot of that noise is actually in our heads - the interminable fizz of anxious thoughts or the self-regarding monologue that for much of the time constitutes our consciousness. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Such a mental voice is also a source of self-regard. This is the catch that springs the trap. The mind wishes the monologue to end, and yet, simultaneously not to end. If it did end, where would identity be? It yearns for silence and fears silence. The two emotions grow stronger together. For example, when a person contemplates a radical change in life - going to live alone in the moors of Galway perhaps, or to a 10-day silent Buddhist retreat - the more he or she yearns for it, the more he or she fears the moment of change. So our ideas of silence are tied up with questions of self-loathing and self-regard. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Our desire for silence often has more to do with an inner silence than an outer. Or a combination of the two. Noise provokes our anger, or at least an engagement, and prevents inner silence. But absence of noise exposes us to the loud voice in our heads. This voice is constitutive of what we call self. If we want it to fall silent, aren&rsquo;t we yearning for the end of self? <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We have strategies for getting by. There are soft solutions such as listening to music, or reading. Consciousness is invited to follow someone else&rsquo;s score or storyline. We temporarily hand over the controls to another director. But as soon as we stop reading or listening, the mental noise starts again. More mortifying are solutions involving ritual prayer, rosaries, or mantras which feel like a full-scale assault on the self, with acoustic weapons. Despite, or perhaps because of, my religious childhood, I have never desired a mantra because I did not resolve anything or learn anything about myself: the mental noise starts again. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Or one might try Vipassana - a form of mediation that goes to the heart of this conflict between yearning for silence and fearing it.

It is as if, as the body is slowly put together and all its component parts unite in an intense present, so the historical self is taken apart and falls away.
