not immune to external events and are going to feel negative emotions. But recognizing that our mind-set is not at the mercy of external events but rather something that is under our own control can go a long way in fostering a healthier, happier outlook. And it can help us maintain emotional wellbeing when things do go wrong &ndash; which they will. All of us will experience setbacks and loss. But it is only our assessment of the loss and how much power we choose to give it, especially through emotion &ndash; that makes us sad. And our wellbeing, conversely, is also entirely in our own control &ndash; should we only choose. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1925_1"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu3":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>According to the passage, one need not feel sad when something bad has happened to them because\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>our internal judgment is not under the control of any external event.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>life is full of such events and it is part of being alive.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>to go through life without getting bullied by life is unhealthy.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>it is common and everyone in the world experiences it.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"a","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"4847","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i>:<\/i><b> <\/b>The passage given below is accompanied by a set of three questions. Choose the best answer to each question. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>E<\/b>xternal events do not harm us &ndash; only our responses to them can. It may sound counterintuitive &ndash; &ldquo;Of course external events can harm us!&rdquo; we might protest, &ldquo;I can get hit by a bus, or my partner might leave me!&rdquo; But the reality is that the story doesn&rsquo;t actually end with the external occurrence, even though so many people think it does. We perceive and talk about these events as though they are the defining moment, and sort of gloss over everything available to us afterwards. These events only have the power that we choose to give them. They only destroy us because we think they are destructive, and allow them to ruin our lives. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Eleanor Roosevelt famously said, &ldquo;No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.&rdquo; The same is true with anything external &ndash; not just other people. If our judgment about any event is that it is horrible, then we allow ourselves to dwell in the belief that we are far worse off if they happen. But if we strip external events of their power, and reclaim our internal power to decide, gauge, and assign value, we maintain control of our lives. Because our internal judgments are independent of external events, the occurrence of a bad event does not necessarily have to result in sadness. If we lose something dear to us, the problem is not the loss, but our outlook on it. Life results in loss. Loss will happen. It&rsquo;s part of being alive. And while loss looks different from person to person and we may experience different things, to go through life allowing any loss to bully us would mean surrendering our control and wellbeing. We assign too much power to internal emotions as well. And not nearly enough to reason and balance; to reclaiming control rather than allowing ourselves to be rocked by what we feel. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p

By this he meant \u201crare, exciting, oceanic, deeply moving, exhilarating, elevating experiences that generate an advanced form of perceiving reality\u201d.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The psychologists Paul Piff and Dacher Keltner claim to have found that experiences of awe can lead to significant positive changes in behaviour. They monitored people on white-water rafting trips and visits to groves of giant trees in California and found that, compared to a control group, these people afterwards made more ethical decisions and showed greater generosity and compassion. \u201cEven brief experiences of awe,\u201d they concluded, \u201clead people to feel less narcissistic and entitled, and more attuned to the common humanity we share.\u201d Piff and Keltner have become firm advocates of what they call \u201ceveryday awe\u201d, and encourage people to actively seek it out.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">I prefer the term \u201cwonder\u201d to \u201cawe\u201d. For me, awe, even in its everyday clothes, is redolent of something that almost overwhelms us. Wonder, by contrast, is a state in which we remain in possession of our intellectual faculties as well as feel emotionally elevated. It has much in common with awe, but it also overlaps with curiosity. \u201cWhen experiencing wonder,\u201d writes the scholar Matthew Bevis, \u201cit feels as if we know something without quite being sure of what we know.\u201d Wonder is a state of deep attention in which we feel good and think clearly, and connect to phenomena beyond ourselves. What makes us wonder changes according to circumstances, age and culture. It may be something as apparently banal as the sounds from a rainstick. It may be the fact that, every second, billions of neutrinos (subatomic particles) from the sun are streaming through your body at almost the speed of light, and do so even at night when the sun is on the other side of the Earth and the neutrinos are passing straight through the Earth first.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Living in wonder does not change the fact that we fail, suffer and die. But it can help us to take a benign stance towards what the philosopher Roberto Unger calls the root human experience of groundlessness, which he describes as \u201castonishment that we exist, that the world exists, and that the world and our situation in it are the way they are rather than another way\u201d. In doing so, we may feel a sense of renewal and act with greater care.<b><u>\n<\/u><\/b><\/font><b><u>\n<\/u><\/b><\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1925"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu10":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>According to the passage, which of the following features is one NOT likely to find in a Jane Austen's novel?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Characters who belonged to the upper class.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>A sophisticated and urbane society.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>A celebration of egotism and societal realities at the turn of the 19<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup> century.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>A display of extravagance and luxury.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"c","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"4849","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>0<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>2<\/i><i>:<\/i><b> <\/b>The passage given below is accompanied by a set of three questions.

I think we can discern at least three, which can be best described in terms of dichotomies. We have: Nature versus Culture, Nature versus the Supernatural, and Nature versus Nurture. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">When writers, poets and singers wax lyrical about nature, they are not typically singing the praises of quantum mechanics or the genome. What they are thinking about is the world beyond human civilization and culture. In English this connotation apparently dates from the 1660s, when the scientific revolution was beginning to gain momentum. Humans began to see many of their actions as artificial &ndash; born of artifice. I&#39;m sure many nature-lovers and environmentalists would find the following sentence rather annoying: &ldquo;Beavers naturally make dams; humans naturally make plastic.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Interestingly, the word &#39;culture&#39; comes from the Latin &#39;cultura&#39;, which means cultivation and agriculture, and stems from the word &#39;colere&#39; which means to till or tend. So culture meant a furrowed rural field long before it meant a furrowed urban brow. The rural home of agriculture &ndash; perhaps the oldest social invention &ndash; is now seen as the grey border territory that separates culture from wild, untamed nature. Beyond the towns lie the fields, and beyond the fields... the forests, the deserts, the wilderness. There lie the places and things we have not yet named. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">If nature is, by definition, whatever is free of human manipulation, then we can never speak of a natural human environment in the same way that we speak of a natural animal environment. But what humans do is intricately linked with the environments of animals. Sometimes &#39;artificial&#39; ecologies are more resilient than the ones that were displaced. Environmentalists and conservationists often deploy the word &#39;nature&#39; as something that does not belong to humans, but that humans must nevertheless actively steward. This places humankind outside of nature and yet somehow instrumental in maintaining it. Climate change is clearly a threat to life on the entire planet, but the planet has been through disasters in the past. The fossil record suggests that Mother Nature does not seem to be particularly concerned with protecting animals and plants from extinction. Whether we like it or not, the desire to preserve biodiversity and ecosystems is a very human desire. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Change is &#39;in the nature&#39; of things.

I think we can discern at least three, which can be best described in terms of dichotomies. We have: Nature versus Culture, Nature versus the Supernatural, and Nature versus Nurture. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">When writers, poets and singers wax lyrical about nature, they are not typically singing the praises of quantum mechanics or the genome. What they are thinking about is the world beyond human civilization and culture. In English this connotation apparently dates from the 1660s, when the scientific revolution was beginning to gain momentum. Humans began to see many of their actions as artificial &ndash; born of artifice. I&#39;m sure many nature-lovers and environmentalists would find the following sentence rather annoying: &ldquo;Beavers naturally make dams; humans naturally make plastic.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Interestingly, the word &#39;culture&#39; comes from the Latin &#39;cultura&#39;, which means cultivation and agriculture, and stems from the word &#39;colere&#39; which means to till or tend. So culture meant a furrowed rural field long before it meant a furrowed urban brow. The rural home of agriculture &ndash; perhaps the oldest social invention &ndash; is now seen as the grey border territory that separates culture from wild, untamed nature. Beyond the towns lie the fields, and beyond the fields... the forests, the deserts, the wilderness. There lie the places and things we have not yet named. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">If nature is, by definition, whatever is free of human manipulation, then we can never speak of a natural human environment in the same way that we speak of a natural animal environment. But what humans do is intricately linked with the environments of animals. Sometimes &#39;artificial&#39; ecologies are more resilient than the ones that were displaced. Environmentalists and conservationists often deploy the word &#39;nature&#39; as something that does not belong to humans, but that humans must nevertheless actively steward. This places humankind outside of nature and yet somehow instrumental in maintaining it. Climate change is clearly a threat to life on the entire planet, but the planet has been through disasters in the past. The fossil record suggests that Mother Nature does not seem to be particularly concerned with protecting animals and plants from extinction. Whether we like it or not, the desire to preserve biodiversity and ecosystems is a very human desire. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Change is &#39;in the nature&#39; of things.

Nearly 40 years later, during World War I, the federal government concluded that depleting U.S. oil supplies required reliance on oil-shale resources. In 1952, the Paley Commission estimated that by the 1970s, the United States would have to shift its reliance from oil to coal and synthetic fuels. .... Because oil is a finite resource, the world has been \u2018running out\u2019 of oil since the first barrel was extracted, and oil supply eventually will not be capable of satisfying rising world demand at prevailing prices. Thus, the peaking of world oil production has been a matter of speculation in the mid-1800s, and for 150 years, energy analysts have been claiming that the world peak would occur in the next 25 years.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">No one knows, however, precisely when the peak will occur. A unique and frustrating aspect of the world oil peak problem is that its timing is uncertain in large part due to inadequate and potentially biased reserves data from around the world.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Reserves are an estimate of the amount of oil in a reservoir that can be extracted at an assumed cost. Thus, a higher oil-price outlook often means that more oil can be extracted, and the reserves will increase. But geology also limited reserves growth. In well-managed oil fields, the maximum increase in reserves is usually only 10 to 20 percent, no matter how high the price. Reserves estimates are revised periodically as new information becomes available from the developed fields, but reserves estimation was hampered by the inherently limited information we could obtain about complex rock formations located miles below the surface. Sometimes large errors occurred as was the case with Shell\u2019s recent reserves markdown of more than 20 percent.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">With publicly available data on reserves sometimes grossly unreliable, estimating the amount of available oil becomes a complex technical, political and institutional problem. For example, when OPEC decided during the 1980s to base its quotas, in part, on oil reserves instead of production, a number of its members immediately doubled or tripled their reserves estimates. In Iraq, reserves reports of 100 billion barrels came out every year from 1985 to 1998, despite no major new discoveries while the country continued to produce oil.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Extensive drilling for oil and gas has provided a massive worldwide database, and current geological knowledge is much more extensive than in years past. Also, various seismic and other exploration technologies have advanced dramatically in recent decades, greatly improving our ability to discover new oil reservoirs. Nevertheless, the number of oil reserves discovered per exploratory well has been declining worldwide for more than a decade.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">We are finding less oil inspite of vigorous efforts, suggesting that nature may not have much more to provide. As such, many credible analysts have recently become much more pessimistic about the possibility of finding the huge new reserves needed to meet growing world demand. Even optimistic forecasts suggest that the world oil peak will occur in less than 20 years.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Oil peaking is a liquid-fuels problem for the transportation sector, not an \u2018energy crisis\u2019 in the sense that the term has been often used. Frequently publicized energy alternatives, such as solar, wind, photovoltaics, nuclear power, geothermal, fusion and others, do not produce liquid fuels, so they cannot affect transportation until major technology shifts from the use of liquid fuels to other replacements are implemented on a significant scale.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Contrary to a recent spate of doomsday books, the peak of conventional world oil production will not result in the end of modern civilization.

The immune system remembers an encounter with a bacteria or virus by collecting fragments from the microbe to create memory T cells, which last for months or years and help the body recognize a previous infection and quickly respond. These memory T cells appear to abstract &#39;gist information&#39; about the pathogens, allowing memory T cells to detect new pathogens that are similar, but not identical, to previously encountered bacteria or viruses. Studies in humans have shown that long-term increases in memory T cells are associated with deep slow-wave sleep on the nights after vaccination. The findings support the view that slow-wave sleep contributes to the formation of long-term memories of abstract, generalized information, which leads to adaptive behavioural and immunological responses. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Deep slow-wave sleep supports immunological memory formation by enhancing the effects of memory T cells which can isolate new pathogens identical to previously encountered ones and destroy them.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Deep slow-wave sleep contributes to the formation of long-term memories of abstract, generalized information, through the mediation of memory T cells and this leads to adaptive behavioural and immunological responses.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Deep slow-wave sleep especially on the nights after vaccination exhibit an increase in memory T cells which are responsible for helping the immune system remember an encounter with a pathogen by abstracting gist information about it and detect a similar pathogen when encountered later.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Deep slow-wave sleep is the constructive phase of sleep for recuperation of the mind-body system in which it rebuilds itself after each day.
