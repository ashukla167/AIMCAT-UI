The waste products that are filtered through the brain prevent neurological illnesses like Alzheimer\u2019s and Parkinson\u2019s. Nedergaard\u2019s research was followed up by a 2013 study which found \u201chidden caves\u201d open up in the brain while we sleep, allowing cerebrospinal fluid to flush neurotoxins through the spinal column in copious amounts.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Basically, the cerebrospinal fluid sits around your brain and spinal cord and \u201cevery six to eight hour period, filters through the brain while you\u2019re asleep,\u201d Tara Swart, a senior lecturer at MIT specializing in sleep and the brain, told Quartz. \u201cThe whole process takes six to eight hours.\u201d\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Much more important than your average cleaning system, this process clears neurotoxins out of your brain, specifically one called beta-amyloid, which has been found in clumps in the brains of people with Alzheimer\u2019s disease.

Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">What is arguably one of the most conservative of all professions has already been quietly undergoing a technological revolution: many lawyers now use automated document-retrieval systems to store, sort and search through mountains of documents. But the introduction of smarter programs, capable of not just assisting lawyers but actually performing some of their functions, could turn the profession on its head. Such software could both improve access to justice and massively reduce legal costs, both for the client and the courts.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">That is not to say that laptops will soon be representing people in court. But when a civil case goes to court it is usually a good indication that all other options have failed. Technology has the potential to preclude this last resort. \u201cYou move from a culture of dispute resolution to dispute avoidance,\u201d says Richard Susskind, a law professor who is technology adviser to Britain\"s Lord Chief Justice. Making legal advice more accessible, he says, means people are more likely to seek advice before getting themselves into trouble.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Some such programs already exist online and are currently being used by lawyers, says John Zeleznikow, a computer scientist at Victoria University in Australia and one of the orchestrators of this transformation. Although current programs are designed to help lawyers give advice, this is just the beginning. The trend, he says, is to make such services available to the masses. One service is designed to help resolve property disputes between divorcing couples.

Here is how I go about it. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">For all the talk of overturned theories, cosmologists have firmly established the foundations of our field. Over the past 70 years we have gathered abundant evidence that our universe is expanding and cooling. First, the light from distant galaxies is shifted toward the red, as it should be if space is expanding and galaxies are pulled away from one another. Second, a sea of thermal radiation fills space, as it should if space used to be denser and hotter. Third, the universe contains large amounts of deuterium and helium, as it should if temperatures were once much higher. Fourth, galaxies billions of years ago look distinctly younger, as they should if they are closer to the time when no galaxies existed. Finally, the curvature of spacetime seems to be related to the material content of the universe, as it should be if the universe is expanding according to the predictions of Einstein\"s gravity theory, the general theory of relativity. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">That the universe is expanding and cooling is the essence of the big bang theory. You will notice I have said nothing about an \"explosion\"--the big bang theory describes how our universe is evolving, not how it began. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">I compare the process of establishing such compelling results, in cosmology or any other science, to the assembly of a framework. We seek to reinforce each piece of evidence by adding cross bracing from diverse measurements. Our framework for the expansion of the universe is braced tightly enough to be solid. The big bang theory is no longer seriously questioned; it fits together too well. Even the most radical alternative--the latest incarnation of the steady state theory--does not dispute that the universe is expanding and cooling. You still hear differences of opinion in cosmology, to be sure, but they concern additions to the solid part. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">For example, we do not know what the universe was doing before it was expanding. A leading theory, inflation, is an attractive addition to the framework, but it lacks cross bracing. That is precisely what cosmologists are now seeking. If measurements in progress agree with the unique signatures of inflation, then we will count them as a persuasive argument for this theory. But until that time, I would not settle any bets on whether inflation really happened. I am not criticizing the theory; I simply mean that this is brave, pioneering work still to be tested. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">More solid is the evidence that most of the mass of the universe consists of dark matter clumped around the outer parts of galaxies. We also have a reasonable case for Einstein\"s infamous cosmological constant or something similar; it would be the agent of the acceleration that the universe now seems to be undergoing. A decade ago cosmologists generally welcomed dark matter as an elegant way to account for the motions of stars and gas within galaxies. Most researchers, however, had a real distaste for the cosmological constant. Now the majority accept it, or its allied concept, quintessence. Particle physicists have come to welcome the challenge that the cosmological constant poses for quantum theory. These shifts in opinion are not reflections of some inherent weakness; rather they show the subject in a healthy state of chaos around a slowly growing fixed framework.

At a convention, Baptista played a tape which included a phrase in Western music: &quot;Ba-ba-ba baaahm.&quot; A high-pitched version of the opening of Beethoven&#39;s Fifth Symphony rang out unmistakably but Baptista said the notes actually came from a white-breasted wood wren in Mexico. Baptista also played other suspicious phrases, which form the lilting opening to the rondo of Beethoven&#39;s &#39;Violin Concerto in D, Opus 61&#39;. A birder noted in 1953 that a European blackbird, a relative of U.S. robins, had come up with the same theme. Almost 30 years later, another sharp listener reported the same blackbird song. Both he and Baptista noted that generations of blackbirds seem to have preserved that tune, so perhaps it dated back to a time when Beethoven himself heard and borrowed it.<\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Beethoven has been accused of plagiarising tunes from songbirds. Birders have noted a striking similarity between his 'Violin Concerto in D, Opus 61' and the song notes of the white-breasted wood wren. There is also a resemblance between the opening of Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and the song of the U.S. robins.\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>The song of the songbird and the music created by Beethoven sound astonishingly similar and represent one of the many convergences Baptista has found between music and birdsongs. The song of the European blackbird seems to have been preserved through the generations from Beethoven's time.\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Just as Shakespeare borrowed from well-known stories, so Beethoven drew on the natural sounds and rhythms around him. The striking similarity between the song of the European blackbird and part of his 'Violin Concerto in D, Opus 61' as well as the similarity between the notes of the white-breasted wood wren and the opening of his Fifth Symphony proves the theory that composers like Beethoven have taken their inspiration from birdsong.\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Beethoven, a composer, may have been inspired by birdsongs. People endorse this view after observing the similarity of Beethoven\u2019s 'Violin Concerto in D, Opus 61' to the European blackbird tunes spanning many generations. Baptista also showed that there is similitude between Beethoven's Fifth Symphony and the notes from a white-breasted wood wren in Mexico. \r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","CORRECT_ANSWER":"d","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu34":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>33 <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>34<\/i><i>: <\/i>Four alternative summaries are given below the text.

Even a cursory glance of competing translations displays thousands of differing word choices, many of which alter the rhythm, the syntax and, to varying degrees, the meaning of the work. To take one telling example, here is Lyngstad&rsquo;s translation of the third sentence from Hamsun&rsquo;s novel, &ldquo;Victoria&rdquo;: &ldquo;When he grew up he wanted to be a maker of matches.&rdquo; But this is how an earlier translator, Oliver Stallybrass, rendered it: &ldquo;When he grew up he would work in a match factory.&rdquo; I cannot say which version is truer, but the differences are plain. Lyngstad gives us an ambitious boy determined to set the world on fire.
