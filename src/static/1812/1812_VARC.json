It was a community in which the ownership of land, and of the simple tools used in most industries, was not the badge of a class, but the attribute of a society, and in which the typical worker was a peasant farmer, a tradesman, or a small master. In this world of small property-owners, of whose independence and prosperity English publicists boasted, in contrast with the &ldquo;housed beggars&rdquo; of France and Germany, the wage-earners were a minority and being, normally themselves the sons of peasants, with the prospect of stepping into a holding of their own, were often in a strong position vis-a-vis their employers. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The special economic malaise of an age is naturally the obverse of its special qualities. The grievance, which supplied fuel to social agitation, which evoked programs of social reform, and which prompted both legislation and administrative activity, sprang not from the exploitation of a wage-earning proletariat by its employers, but from the relation of the producer to his landlord, the dealer with whom he bought and sold, and the local capitalist to whom he ran into debt. The farmer must borrow money when the season is bad. The craftsman must buy raw materials on credit and get advances before his wares are sold. The young tradesman must scrape together a little capital before he can set up shop. Even the cottager must constantly ask the seller to &ldquo;give day&rdquo;. Almost everyone has need of the money-lender who is a monopolist &ndash; &lsquo;a money-master&rsquo;, a corn monger, a rich priest &ndash; the solitary capitalist in a community of peasants and artisans. Naturally, he is apt to become their master. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It is not surprising that there should have been a popular outcry against extortion. The doctrine as to the ethics of economic conduct, which had been formulated by medieval Popes was rehearsed by the English divines of the sixteenth century, not merely as the conventional tribute paid by a formal piety to the wisdom of the past, but because the swift changes of the period in commerce and agriculture had, not softened, but accentuated, the problems of conduct for which it had been designed. Nor was it only against the particular case of the covetous moneylender that the preacher and the moralist directed their arrows. The essence of the medieval scheme of economic ethics had been its insistence on equity in bargaining &ndash; a contract is fair, St. Thomas had said, when both parties gain from it equally. The prohibition of &lsquo;usury&rsquo; had been the kernel of its doctrines, not because the gains of the money-lender were the only species, ___________________<\/font><\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In reality, alike in the Middle Ages, the word &lsquo;usury&rsquo; had not the specialized sense that it carries today. Like the modern profiteer, the usurer was a character so unpopular that most unpopular characters could be called usurers, and by the average practical man almost any form of bargain which he thought oppressive would be classed as usurious. The interpretation placed on the word by those who expounded ecclesiastical theories of usury was equally elastic. ... If the common man was asked why usury was wrong, he would have quoted from scripture. If he was asked for a definition of usury, he would have repeated the words of a member of parliament who spoke on the Bill introduced in 1571: &ldquo;It standeth doubtful what usury is; we have no true definition of it.&rdquo; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1812_1"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu8":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>From the sentence, \u201cThe special economic malaise of an age is naturally the obverse of its special qualities\u201d (para 3), we infer that the author is referring to that aspect of society where\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>the serious economic problems of an age are the reverse of its noteworthy traits.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>independence in vocation and dependence on external assistance go hand in hand.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>the remarkable economic feature of the society generally has an opposing trend.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>the distinctive aspect of a community is offset by its unusual virtuosity.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"3885","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b> <i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>7<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>2<\/i><i>:<\/i> The passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.

The weakness of an attitude which met the onset of insurgent economic interests with a generalized appeal to traditional morality and an idealization of the past was only too obvious. Thrown on to a helpless defensive by changes even in a slowly moving world of agriculture, medieval social theory found itself swept off its feet after the middle of the century by the swift rise of a commercial civilization, in which all traditional landmarks seemed to be submerged. The issue over which the struggle between the new economic movements of the age and the scheme of economic ethics expounded by churchmen was most definitely joined, was not that of wages, but that of credit, money-lending and prices. The center of the controversy was the problem which contemporaries described by the word &lsquo;usury&rsquo;. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In spite of property, Tudor England was still a Distributive State. It was a community in which the ownership of land, and of the simple tools used in most industries, was not the badge of a class, but the attribute of a society, and in which the typical worker was a peasant farmer, a tradesman, or a small master. In this world of small property-owners, of whose independence and prosperity English publicists boasted, in contrast with the &ldquo;housed beggars&rdquo; of France and Germany, the wage-earners were a minority and being, normally themselves the sons of peasants, with the prospect of stepping into a holding of their own, were often in a strong position vis-a-vis their employers. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The special economic malaise of an age is naturally the obverse of its special qualities. The grievance, which supplied fuel to social agitation, which evoked programs of social reform, and which prompted both legislation and administrative activity, sprang not from the exploitation of a wage-earning proletariat by its employers, but from the relation of the producer to his landlord, the dealer with whom he bought and sold, and the local capitalist to whom he ran into debt. The farmer must borrow money when the season is bad. The craftsman must buy raw materials on credit and get advances before his wares are sold. The young tradesman must scrape together a little capital before he can set up shop. Even the cottager must constantly ask the seller to &ldquo;give day&rdquo;. Almost everyone has need of the money-lender who is a monopolist &ndash; &lsquo;a money-master&rsquo;, a corn monger, a rich priest &ndash; the solitary capitalist in a community of peasants and artisans. Naturally, he is apt to become their master. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It is not surprising that there should have been a popular outcry against extortion. The doctrine as to the ethics of economic conduct, which had been formulated by medieval Popes was rehearsed by the English divines of the sixteenth century, not merely as the conventional tribute paid by a formal piety to the wisdom of the past, but because the swift changes of the period in commerce and agriculture had, not softened, but accentuated, the problems of conduct for which it had been designed. Nor was it only against the particular case of the covetous moneylender that the preacher and the moralist directed their arrows. The essence of the medieval scheme of economic ethics had been its insistence on equity in bargaining &ndash; a contract is fair, St. Thomas had said, when both parties gain from it equally. The prohibition of &lsquo;usury&rsquo; had been the kernel of its doctrines, not because the gains of the money-lender were the only species, ___________________<\/font><\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In reality, alike in the Middle Ages, the word &lsquo;usury&rsquo; had not the specialized sense that it carries today. Like the modern profiteer, the usurer was a character so unpopular that most unpopular characters could be called usurers, and by the average practical man almost any form of bargain which he thought oppressive would be classed as usurious. The interpretation placed on the word by those who expounded ecclesiastical theories of usury was equally elastic. ... If the common man was asked why usury was wrong, he would have quoted from scripture.

the Aztecs, offered barbarism plus pyramids. But we expect a civilization to be ennobling, to lift us up, to look beyond the endless cyclical violence of the barbaric past, however interesting its art may be. We expect a moral and philosophical perspective on human existence. The &ldquo;examined life&rdquo; as Socrates put it, with the fruit of this examination religiously incorporated. Egypt, India and China had this. Not the Maya. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">One needs a developed form of writing to record evidence that life has been examined, thought about, and critically assayed. It is true the Maya had a rudimentary script ... and a philosophical interest in time. Ronald Wright comments that &ldquo;using their advanced arithmetic in a calendar (Long Count), the Maya charted the mystery of time, recording astronomical events and running mythological calculations far into the past and future.&rdquo; My own impression is that however successful they were in &ldquo;charting the mystery of time&rdquo;, Maya calendrical calculations mainly reflected a mistaken devotion to astrology and numerology &ndash; and a more sterile dead-end it would be hard to find. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">What I look for in a civilization is Mind at Work.

the Aztecs, offered barbarism plus pyramids. But we expect a civilization to be ennobling, to lift us up, to look beyond the endless cyclical violence of the barbaric past, however interesting its art may be. We expect a moral and philosophical perspective on human existence. The &ldquo;examined life&rdquo; as Socrates put it, with the fruit of this examination religiously incorporated. Egypt, India and China had this. Not the Maya. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">One needs a developed form of writing to record evidence that life has been examined, thought about, and critically assayed. It is true the Maya had a rudimentary script ... and a philosophical interest in time. Ronald Wright comments that &ldquo;using their advanced arithmetic in a calendar (Long Count), the Maya charted the mystery of time, recording astronomical events and running mythological calculations far into the past and future.&rdquo; My own impression is that however successful they were in &ldquo;charting the mystery of time&rdquo;, Maya calendrical calculations mainly reflected a mistaken devotion to astrology and numerology &ndash; and a more sterile dead-end it would be hard to find. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">What I look for in a civilization is Mind at Work.

A serious religion with a seriously uplifting ethic is also welcome: failing that, as among the Greeks, let&rsquo;s have a serious freethinker like Xenophanes, who wondered why the faithful always imagine that their gods look like themselves: <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;

the Aztecs, offered barbarism plus pyramids. But we expect a civilization to be ennobling, to lift us up, to look beyond the endless cyclical violence of the barbaric past, however interesting its art may be. We expect a moral and philosophical perspective on human existence. The &ldquo;examined life&rdquo; as Socrates put it, with the fruit of this examination religiously incorporated. Egypt, India and China had this.

It is true the Maya had a rudimentary script ... and a philosophical interest in time. Ronald Wright comments that &ldquo;using their advanced arithmetic in a calendar (Long Count), the Maya charted the mystery of time, recording astronomical events and running mythological calculations far into the past and future.&rdquo; My own impression is that however successful they were in &ldquo;charting the mystery of time&rdquo;, Maya calendrical calculations mainly reflected a mistaken devotion to astrology and numerology &ndash; and a more sterile dead-end it would be hard to find. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">What I look for in a civilization is Mind at Work.

the Aztecs, offered barbarism plus pyramids. But we expect a civilization to be ennobling, to lift us up, to look beyond the endless cyclical violence of the barbaric past, however interesting its art may be. We expect a moral and philosophical perspective on human existence. The &ldquo;examined life&rdquo; as Socrates put it, with the fruit of this examination religiously incorporated. Egypt, India and China had this. Not the Maya. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">One needs a developed form of writing to record evidence that life has been examined, thought about, and critically assayed. It is true the Maya had a rudimentary script ... and a philosophical interest in time. Ronald Wright comments that &ldquo;using their advanced arithmetic in a calendar (Long Count), the Maya charted the mystery of time, recording astronomical events and running mythological calculations far into the past and future.&rdquo; My own impression is that however successful they were in &ldquo;charting the mystery of time&rdquo;, Maya calendrical calculations mainly reflected a mistaken devotion to astrology and numerology &ndash; and a more sterile dead-end it would be hard to find. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">What I look for in a civilization is Mind at Work.

A serious religion with a seriously uplifting ethic is also welcome: failing that, as among the Greeks, let&rsquo;s have a serious freethinker like Xenophanes, who wondered why the faithful always imagine that their gods look like themselves: <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;

the Aztecs, offered barbarism plus pyramids. But we expect a civilization to be ennobling, to lift us up, to look beyond the endless cyclical violence of the barbaric past, however interesting its art may be. We expect a moral and philosophical perspective on human existence. The &ldquo;examined life&rdquo; as Socrates put it, with the fruit of this examination religiously incorporated. Egypt, India and China had this. Not the Maya. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">One needs a developed form of writing to record evidence that life has been examined, thought about, and critically assayed. It is true the Maya had a rudimentary script ... and a philosophical interest in time. Ronald Wright comments that &ldquo;using their advanced arithmetic in a calendar (Long Count), the Maya charted the mystery of time, recording astronomical events and running mythological calculations far into the past and future.&rdquo; My own impression is that however successful they were in &ldquo;charting the mystery of time&rdquo;, Maya calendrical calculations mainly reflected a mistaken devotion to astrology and numerology &ndash; and a more sterile dead-end it would be hard to find. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">What I look for in a civilization is Mind at Work.

A serious religion with a seriously uplifting ethic is also welcome: failing that, as among the Greeks, let&rsquo;s have a serious freethinker like Xenophanes, who wondered why the faithful always imagine that their gods look like themselves: <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;

the Aztecs, offered barbarism plus pyramids. But we expect a civilization to be ennobling, to lift us up, to look beyond the endless cyclical violence of the barbaric past, however interesting its art may be. We expect a moral and philosophical perspective on human existence. The &ldquo;examined life&rdquo; as Socrates put it, with the fruit of this examination religiously incorporated. Egypt, India and China had this. Not the Maya. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">One needs a developed form of writing to record evidence that life has been examined, thought about, and critically assayed. It is true the Maya had a rudimentary script ... and a philosophical interest in time. Ronald Wright comments that &ldquo;using their advanced arithmetic in a calendar (Long Count), the Maya charted the mystery of time, recording astronomical events and running mythological calculations far into the past and future.&rdquo; My own impression is that however successful they were in &ldquo;charting the mystery of time&rdquo;, Maya calendrical calculations mainly reflected a mistaken devotion to astrology and numerology &ndash; and a more sterile dead-end it would be hard to find. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">What I look for in a civilization is Mind at Work.

A serious religion with a seriously uplifting ethic is also welcome: failing that, as among the Greeks, let&rsquo;s have a serious freethinker like Xenophanes, who wondered why the faithful always imagine that their gods look like themselves: <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t&nbsp;

The distinction between innate and acquired traits in an organism might be understood within the area of psychology only as other fields such as molecular developmental biology and genetics have not been able to pinpoint the same. Recent philosophical analyses of the innate\/acquired distinction can be classified into four types. The first identifies innate traits with those characteristic of an entire species and identifies acquired traits with those that vary between populations and individuals. The second identifies innate traits with those that can be explained by natural selection. The third, and most influential, identifies innate traits with those produced by a particular patterns of interaction between genes and environment. The fourth is different and suggests that labelling a trait &lsquo;innate&rsquo; is a way to indicate that it lies outside the domain of psychology. Philosophical scepticism about innateness draws on a longstanding tradition of scepticism in developmental psychobiology. This research tradition interprets many of its own results as demonstrating the inadequacy of the innate \/acquired distinction. Once again, this suggests that the distinction may be best understood via its actual use in psychological research.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The distinction between innate and acquired traits is largely a psychological one since it has not been supported by genetics or molecular developmental biology. Any relationship between genetic causation and the innate\/acquired distinction will be far more complex than saying that innate traits are &lsquo;caused by genes&rsquo; whilst acquired traits are &lsquo;caused by the environment&rsquo;. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The age-old debate between innate and acquired traits has not yet been resolved due to the reliance on genetics and molecular biology instead of psychological research. The idea that genetics and molecular developmental biology measure the degree to which a characteristic is innate is a vulgar fallacy. While three types of philosophical analyses explain the innate \/acquired distinction, the fourth type draws our attention towards philosophical scepticism about innateness. Psychological research surfaces as the best area to study innateness. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Psychology still remains the only area within which the distinction between innate and acquired traits might be understood as other areas have failed to clarify the distinction. While three types of philosophical analyses explain the innate \/acquired distinction, the fourth type is unique as it highlights the scepticism in proving the adequacy of the innate\/acquired distinction. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The distinction between innate and acquired traits holds no water since studies have shown that no single property of a trait corresponds to its being innate.
