If one classes them according to their purely external appearance, the diverse works of art can be divided up into differing groups and subgroups of varying size. In general, these groups of artworks form relatively closed spatial and temporal unities.

A specific artistic \u201cform\u201d (a motif) can be picked out, for example, the ornamental spiral motif or the architectural form of the basilica, and one searches for the forms that have grown genetically out of it. A genetic series is thus established, in which one and the same genetically identical form (motif) undergoes metamorphoses in its artistic characteristics, its style. The same form persists, as it were, through various styles.

Forms are transformed, their \u201cexternal character,\u201d their style changes, now the simple question is raised as to what drives this formal change. What is changing at a fundamental level, when the surface style changes? One can thus also phrase the second question as follows: We know the dependent variable factor, namely the style of works of art; what is the variable independent of all others? These two questions are not of equal importance; most immediately we shall give prominence to the second.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Various answers have been given to this question. One answer, or, more precisely, one <i>apparent <\/i>answer, that of Semper or, more properly, Semperians, is that purpose, material, and techniques change, and that these are the determinants of style. There is an intellectual factor in addition which can be ignored (and this is a mistake) because it is secondary. If one then asks further what these three variables depend on, one comes to the result that since blind chance is not admitted the independent variable is the material culture: crass materialism! There is no need at all to develop this point of view through to its final consequences. For it is clear that according to this answer, style means something quite different from what it meant in our question, and that our question only has the appearance of having been answered... In terms of our concept of style, forms that have been executed with different materials and techniques and for different purposes can remain unchanged. This solution is thus useless for us. Riegl comprehensively criticized this answer and one other, which no one holds to today.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Riegl himself offered an opposing answer. The independent variable is the \u201cdirection of the <i>Kunstwollen<\/i>\u201d to use the rough general expression. The purpose, the material and the technique also change, but they are negative factors, mere \u201cfrictional coefficients,\u201d which have to be subtracted in order to recognize the pure \u201cdirection of the art drive\u201d that is the positive determining factor. In any case, two of them are partly dependent on the direction of the art drive, which also determine the choice of material and technique. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Here we have arrived at the concept and theory of the art drive on the basis of questions raised by the concrete praxis of scholarly research. The concept is introduced to clarify the quite concrete phenomenon of style.

So our second question arises: what is a combinatorial argument?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Explored, known mathematical results can be pictured as a huge imaginary edifice of truths all derivable from one another and from certain original principles. Mathematicians typically try to extend this structure, or apply parts of it to the real world, or both. Such efforts consist of arguments, every argument containing two components: knowledge about the existing structure of mathematics, and <i>ingenuity<\/i>, including complex, devious, and perhaps very detailed and complicated reasoning.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">A <i>combinatorial <\/i><i>argument <\/i>is one that consists predominantly of ingenuity is detailed reasoning rather than knowledge of existing mathematics. This is in contrast to a <i>knowledge<\/i><i>-<\/i><i>based <\/i>argument, which relied heavily on piecing together known results. An argument of the following form is not combinatorial: by the theorem of X we have A; by the theorem of Y we have B; from A and B we get the desired conclusion. This kind of argument is based heavily on knowledge of the theorems of X and of Y. It could, however, be a combinatorial argument to you if you were ignorant of the theorems and recreated them yourself.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">It is obvious why combinatorial arguments, and by extension, combinatorial subjects were never popular among traditional mathematicians. They spent much of their lives learning lore about their subject. Combinatorial arguments tend to ignore this knowledge. Combinatorics can be attempted by inspired amateurs and dilettantes who know little of formal mathematics, and much of it was developed by such people. One goal of formal mathematics is to systematize the structure of mathematical knowledge to abolish the need for intricate reasoning and thought. Combinatorics therefore represents the areas of mathematics that are failures in this sense, those for which systematic developments of past knowledge are relatively useless in attacking present problems.

The more refined the artist\"s creative impulses, the clearer are his visual messages in sharing his thoughts, feelings, perceptions and other creative faculties with his audience. Imagination is the prior cause, which precedes the expression of art as its effect. The conception of art is superior to its execution. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The magic of art does not exist in its execution, or presentation of feelings and mental imagery independently exterior to the mind of its creator. Execution of art is only the mechanical expertise; the externalization by which the art is expressed. The magic of art resides within the intellectual awareness of the mind, in conceiving and forming of ideas. The creation process is limited by the physical possibilities available with the material universe. ...\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Between the artist who creates the art, and the viewer who contemplates it, lies the magic of expressive imagination. It is our own creative impulses, perceptions and recognition of the aesthetic expressions within the art that allows us to experience what is being resonating to us from the artist; and thus, becoming engaged in a dialogue and exploration with the artist through his art; the art is a spiritual connection to the artist. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Visual arts, much similar to the pleasant dialogues and conversations that we enjoy with our associates, friends and family, follow the same basic principles of verbal communication in its success or failure. <b>An <\/b><b>artist <\/b><b>with <\/b><b>low <\/b><b>imagination<\/b><b>, <\/b><b>who <\/b><b>does <\/b><b>not <\/b><b>originate <\/b><b>verbally<\/b><b>, <\/b><b>does <\/b><b>not <\/b><b>communicate <\/b><b>visually <\/b><b>either<\/b>. He originates no visual messages in his art, or when he does, it is so vaguely done, that it stirs up no interaction with his audience.
