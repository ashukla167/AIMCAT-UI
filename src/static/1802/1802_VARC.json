With many of the best brands snapped up, extending existing brands is becoming popular again. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">From booze to lipstick, consumer brands were the prizes which sparked some of the biggest takeover battles and grandest break-up schemes of the 1980s. Bidders and break-up artists thought they could sell well-known brands or exploit them better than existing managers. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The steam has gone out of the takeover market, and few big brands still carry &quot;for sale&quot; signs. After a massive reshuffle of brand portfolios, managers in consumer goods industries are returning to an old standby of marketing: brand-stretching. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Brand stretching - using the recognition value and reputation of a brand-name in a new product area - is often a quick and cheap way for a company to invade a new market. But brands are not endlessly elastic. Stretching can also undermine the credibility of the original product. Consumers either may not believe that the new product shares any of the characteristics of the old, or they may simply forget what was attractive about the original item. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Nevertheless, many companies are beginning to stretch their brands for the same reason that they once scrambled to buy established brands at ever-higher prices: launching a new brand can be even riskier and more expensive. Nielsen, a market-research firm, found that, of America&#39;s top twenty-two brands back in 1925, nineteen still led their product categories 60 years later. Britain&#39;s top ten grocery brands have an average age of forty-two. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Brand-stretching can save money. OC &amp; C, a London based consultancy, recently studied five years worth of new-product launches by one multinational client. Its findings? The advertising and promotion costs per consumer persuaded to try out each new product were 36% less for stretched brands than for completely new ones. Not only did stretched products need less advertising, but consumers were also more willing to give names they already knew an initial trial. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Even well after a new product&#39;s launch, stretched brands have a higher survival rate. OC &amp; C found that, of products launched by the same multinational six years ago, only about 30% of new brands exist today, while over 50% of stretched ones do. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Another concept which has caught on in recent times is personal branding. This is the practice of people marketing themselves and their careers as brands. While previous self-help management techniques were about self-<i>i<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>p<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>v<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>t<\/i>, the personal-branding concept suggests instead that success comes from self-<i>p<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>k<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>g<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>g<\/i>. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Personal branding often involves the application of one&#39;s name to various products. Donald Trump uses his last name extensively on his buildings and on the products he endorses (e.g. Trump Tower). &quot;Your brand is a perception or emotion, maintained by somebody other than you, that describes the total experience of having a relationship with you.&quot; <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Branding is all about product perception. And when that product is you, it&#39;s even more critical the branding process be so perfect that the decision can&#39;t be anything but in your favour. That, in a nutshell, is the premise of Peter Montoya&#39;s <i>T<\/i><i>h<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>B<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>C<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>Y<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>.<\/i><i> <\/i>According to it, a personal brand is &#39;a personal identity that stimulates precise, meaningful perceptions in its audience about the values and qualities that person stands for, personally and professionally.&#39; And, before you ask, no, it&#39;s not the same as advertising and PR. The purpose of creating a personal brand is not to make you famous, emphasises Montoya. It&#39;s about enhancing your sphere of influence, because that&#39;s what generates wealth. Of course, you may become famous, but that&#39;s just a welcome extra, not the ultimate goal.

This is not being &lsquo;unscientific&rsquo; in any way. Scientists do not work with unambiguous facts, they have to place facts in context, to interpret them within a particular framework or theory. In cosmology or atomic physics, this process is relatively uncontroversial. But when we are dealing with the question of human nature \/origins, the creation of the framework within which one places the facts can be contentious, and open to political, philosophical and cultural influences. Virtually all our evolutionary theories about human origins are relatively unconstrained by fossil data. They have often said far more about the theorists than about what actually happened. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Today, the questions of &#39;how and when did we become human?&#39; remain culturally loaded. The key issue for many Darwinists is the similarity of humans and apes. Humans share 98 percent of their genes with chimpanzees. If we take away our clothes, possessions and language, observes Jared Diamond, then we begin to look like an ape. If we remove our marks of humanity, we no longer appear to be human: not a very profound claim. But Diamond doesn&#39;t leave it there. Humanity without their humanity are revealed to be &#39;what they really are&#39;. Diamond&#39;s argument is that &#39;what we really are&#39;, the essence of humanity, has little to do with conventional indices of humanness: language, culture, technology, and so on. Rather it is expressed principally through our animal heritage. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The genetic proximity of Man and ape is without question. One could say, given the tiny genetic difference, that our humanity does not lie in our genes. Or one could argue we are little more than another ape, and the roots of our behaviour must lie in our animal, and in particular ape, ancestry. In adopting the second argument, Darwinists like Diamond are doing more than taking an objective look at the human condition. They are interpreting the scientific data through a particular philosophical lens. They are projecting their vision of what it means to be human on to the data. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">For all Robert Foley&#39;s protestations, then, that evolutionary questions are merely technical ones, Darwinian explanations also draw on philosophical and cultural assumptions about what constitutes humanity, how humans relate to the non-human animal world. &hellip;. If the Victorian insistence on a biological chasm between man and ape originated from an almost mythical belief in human progress, today&#39;s insistence that humans are nothing more than another kind of ape is the consequence of a century&#39;s worth of disillusionment with such optimism. Foley notes: The history of the twentieth century has transformed our vision of humanity, leading to a &#39;loss of confidence in the extent to which humans could be said to be on a pedestal above the swamp of animal brutishness.&#39;<\/font><\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The almost boundless capacity of humans to do damage to each other has, in the twentieth century, rather dented human self-esteem. ..... Apes have become more angelic; the angels, or at least their human representatives, more apish. Originally, humans were thought to be the advanced form of life (the angels), and other animals the more primitive, now it may be argued that the animal within us is our noble side, and humanity the darker side - a complete reversal of the original Victorian image. .... <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fact that scientific explanations of humanness are shaped by wider influences does not necessarily mean that they are wrong. We have to understand arguments about human nature as simultaneously scientific and cultural claims. We need to ask ourselves two intertwined questions.

This is not being &lsquo;unscientific&rsquo; in any way. Scientists do not work with unambiguous facts, they have to place facts in context, to interpret them within a particular framework or theory. In cosmology or atomic physics, this process is relatively uncontroversial. But when we are dealing with the question of human nature \/origins, the creation of the framework within which one places the facts can be contentious, and open to political, philosophical and cultural influences. Virtually all our evolutionary theories about human origins are relatively unconstrained by fossil data. They have often said far more about the theorists than about what actually happened. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Today, the questions of &#39;how and when did we become human?&#39; remain culturally loaded. The key issue for many Darwinists is the similarity of humans and apes. Humans share 98 percent of their genes with chimpanzees. If we take away our clothes, possessions and language, observes Jared Diamond, then we begin to look like an ape. If we remove our marks of humanity, we no longer appear to be human: not a very profound claim. But Diamond doesn&#39;t leave it there. Humanity without their humanity are revealed to be &#39;what they really are&#39;. Diamond&#39;s argument is that &#39;what we really are&#39;, the essence of humanity, has little to do with conventional indices of humanness: language, culture, technology, and so on. Rather it is expressed principally through our animal heritage. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The genetic proximity of Man and ape is without question. One could say, given the tiny genetic difference, that our humanity does not lie in our genes. Or one could argue we are little more than another ape, and the roots of our behaviour must lie in our animal, and in particular ape, ancestry. In adopting the second argument, Darwinists like Diamond are doing more than taking an objective look at the human condition. They are interpreting the scientific data through a particular philosophical lens. They are projecting their vision of what it means to be human on to the data. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">For all Robert Foley&#39;s protestations, then, that evolutionary questions are merely technical ones, Darwinian explanations also draw on philosophical and cultural assumptions about what constitutes humanity, how humans relate to the non-human animal world. &hellip;.

The autobiographical hero of Craig Thompson&#39;s &quot;Blankets,&quot; a guilt-ridden teenager falling in love for the first time, would be insufferably predictable in a prose narrative; here, he has an innocent sweetness. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The graphic novel is also good at depicting blankness and <b>a<\/b><b>n<\/b><b>o<\/b><b>m<\/b><b>i<\/b><b>e<\/b>. This is a strength of Daniel Clowes&#39;s, and also of 30-year-old Adrian Tomine, who may, incidentally, be the best prose writer of the bunch. (He became an English major at the University of California, Berkeley, because the art department had no use for representation, let alone comics.) His young people, falling in and out of relationships, paralyzed by shyness and self-consciousness, might be unendurable if depicted in prose alone. Why would we care? But in Tomine&#39;s precisely rendered drawings (which owe something to Clowes, something to the Hernandez brothers and maybe even a tiny debt to the painter Alex Katz) they take on a certain dignity and individuality. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The graphic novel is great for stories of spookiness and paranoia, as in David Mazzucchelli&#39;s graphic adaptation of Paul Auster&#39;s novella, &quot;City of Glass,&quot; where the panels themselves become confining and claustrophobic, or in Charles Burns&#39;s creepy &quot;Black Hole,&quot; a story about a plague spread by sexually active teenagers. (&quot;Black Hole&quot; is still unfinished, and some graphic artists talk about it the way people talked about &quot;Ulysses&quot; back when it was appearing in installments.) And of course, drawing as it does on the long tradition of comic and satiric art, the graphic novel can be very funny. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In fact, the genre&#39;s greatest strength and greatest weakness is that no matter how far the graphic novel verges toward realism, its basic idiom is always a little, well, cartoonish. This is a medium probably not well suited to lyricism or strong emotion, and the very best graphic novels don&#39;t take themselves entirely seriously. They appeal to that childish part of ourselves that delights in caricature, and they rely on the magic, familiar but always a little startling, that reliably turns some lines, dots and squiggles into a face or a figure. It&#39;s a trick of sorts, but one that never wears out. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1802-3"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu22":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The boldfaced part of the text can be best replaced by .....?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>strongest tendencies\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>characteristic tendencies\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>inherent strengths\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>immanent tendencies\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"d","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"4504","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>2<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>4<\/i><i>:<\/i><b> <\/b>The passage given below is followed by a set of three questions.

In July 2002, a human gene that protects the body from HIV infection was identified by a team of Anglo-American scientists. The gene is named CEM 15 and confers natural resistance to HIV infection.
