Much of this is driven by the needs of the financial sector, which itself has consolidated massively. This paper by the Richmond Fed shows how from 1960 to 2016, the U.S. financial services sector went from 13,000 of independent banks to half that number, while the top ten banks grew from 20% market share to 60%.

Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>T<\/b>he U.S. is one of the few nations on earth where private, for-profit business formation is seen as a quasi-heroic act. The resulting entrepreneurial culture has captured the world\u2019s imagination and driven the nation to great prosperity. Yet now it is clearly faltering.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In a new paper that\u2019s already generated much discussion, economists Ian Hathaway of Ennsyte Economics and Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution document four decades of \u201cDeclining Business Dynamism in the United States.\u201d Looking at data from all fifty states and all metropolitan areas, Hathaway and Litan conclude there\u2019s been a secular decline in business formation throughout the country, with a concurrent increase in business dissolution. The rate of business formation in 2016 was almost half of what it was in 1978, with the rate of dissolution somewhat higher than the past couple decades. When they restate this another way, the implications are clearer: \u201cWhatever the reason, older and larger businesses are doing better relative to younger and smaller ones.\u201d Deep, disruptive economic change is all around us, but the data indicates that the national response has not been, contrary to our myths and history, one of increased entrepreneurship.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Hathaway and Litan stay close to the data in this work and stop short of speculating about causes of this trend. So allow me. While there are numerous factors in such a massive shift away from business formation, one of the most powerful has to be the consolidation of multiple economic sectors toward a handful of firms with hegemonic power over their industry. Much of this is driven by the needs of the financial sector, which itself has consolidated massively. This paper by the Richmond Fed shows how from 1960 to 2016, the U.S. financial services sector went from 13,000 of independent banks to half that number, while the top ten banks grew from 20% market share to 60%. As of 2016, the top ten banks had 70% of the market.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Consolidation of the financial sector has led to similar dynamics in other industries. In pharmaceuticals, the largest company, Pfizer, is the result of decades of mergers. The current corporate entity is comprised of firms that used to be called: King Pharmaceuticals, Wyeth, American Cyanamid, Lederle, Pharmacia, Upjohn, Searle, SUGEN, Warner-Lambert, Parke-Davis and others. In chemicals, energy, technology, beer and more, you can see a multi-decade trend toward the consolidation of behemoths. In the guitar business, too.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">How does this consolidation impact entrepreneurs? Giant firms seek the services of similarly large vendors. New, small entrants into the market will be at pains to form relationships with such firms, and the power imbalance is effectively a monopsony \u2013 <i>s<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>l<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>u<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>t<\/i><i> <\/i><i>o<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>p<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>,<\/i><i> <\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i> <\/i><i>o<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>i<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>v<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>,<\/i><i> <\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>g<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>t<\/i><i> <\/i><i>l<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>.<\/i><i> <\/i>Trying to sell into a world of enormous corporate cartels is considerably more difficult than it was forty years ago, when every sector in America was smaller, more diverse and more dynamic.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Also, consider the need for new products and services in a country full of concentrated industries. When a company had dozens of potential competitors in various geographic regions, there was an incentive to innovate before the other guy does. In a concentrated market, competitors are few, and growth may come more from mergers and government lobbying than new product lines. For entrepreneurs, why start something new in such an environment? The current tech boom might serve as a counterexample, but consider that for most venture-backed companies, the ultimate exit plan is for sale of the firm to an existing behemoth, not continued independent operations.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The American entrepreneurial mythos arose in an environment that was perfect for supporting new businesses: rapid growth, technological change, constant competition, limited government intervention. We need to find ways to bring that environment back.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

Demand for wine in bottles (as opposed to wine in bags) is growing faster than the supply of properly prepared cork, so there is actually plenty of room in the market for different types of stopper. At the top end of the market, that does not necessarily favour plastic. For nobody can yet know whether plastic stoppers will remain sound for the 20 or more years during which the greatest wines mature before they are drunk. On the other hand, &ldquo;the top end&rdquo; accounts for a very small amount of the total wine drunk, and plastic&#39;s chances look correspondingly better. As over 90% of all wine is consumed within a year of being bottled (and within 24 hours of being purchased) for most drinkers the argument about the long-term effects of plastic will seem fairly theoretical. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>",

But many governments have become doubtful of their ability to cope with urbanisation on such an enormous scale; some have concluded that they ought to slow the process down in order to minimise social upheaval. This view owes as much to anti-urban bias as it does to sober analysis. In 2005, more than half of the poor countries surveyed by the UN population division said they wanted to reduce internal migration to rein in urban growth. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Yet new research published by the World Bank in its annual flagship World Development Report suggests that pessimism over the future of huge cities is wildly overdone. The bank argues that third-world cities grow so big and so fast precisely because they generate vast economic advantages, and that these gains may be increasing. Slowing urbanisation down, or pushing it towards places not linked with world markets, is costly and futile, the bank says. At a time of contagion and bail-outs, the research also reaffirms the unfashionable view that the basic facts of geography &ndash; where people live and work, how they get around &ndash; matter as much as financial and fiscal policies. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It is true that cities are unprecedented in size. The average population of the world&quot;s 100 largest cities now exceeds 6m. In 1900, it was only 700,000. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But relative to the size of countries&#39; populations, the current growth is far from unusual. Between 1985 and 2015 the urban share of the population of developing countries rose by eight percentage points. Between 1870 and 1900, the bank says, the urban share in then-industrialising Europe and America went up by about the same amount. .... Urbanisation is accelerating. But history suggests it will not go on rising at this rate for ever. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">History also suggests that the income gaps that worry governments will narrow. As people move to the city, urban wages are typically 40-50% higher than unskilled farm earnings (that was the premium in Europe in the 19th century; it is about the same in developing countries today). But the income gaps of rich countries have narrowed, so living standards in the West today are roughly the same between town and country. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">That convergence is starting in poor countries, too: in poorer Malawi and Sri Lanka, city dwellers account for a much bigger share of consumption than of population (20% compared with 10%). But in richer Chile and Brazil, urbanites account for only slightly more consumption than population. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Why are third-world cities so big? They are not in relative terms all that large. But they are big because they do an economic job that is becoming more, not less, important. Cheap transport in the past 25 years has produced a second sort of trade revolution. Countries now sell each other not final products like port but intermediate ones such as recording heads for hard drives. That has been made possible by an extraordinary fragmentation of production: every step in the production line is broken down. Parts are made separately, then shipped for assembly. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">If it is so important where economic activity takes place, what should countries do if they lack big cities &ndash; perhaps because they are landlocked, or cut off from world markets or have many poor people living in rural areas? These, the bank thinks, are the real problems of urbanisation, not the multiplication of slums or congestion. The answer, in the bank&#39;s view, depends on why people are cut off. If they are trapped in underemployment in remote rural areas, the main task is to establish land markets and basic services (schools, streets, sanitation) to help cities grow. ... <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Where urbanisation has started but pockets of the population are trapped far away, governments have to focus more on transport and other sorts of infrastructure to connect lagging regions with fast-growing ones. It is not until a more advanced stage of urbanisation is reached &ndash; with 75% of the population in cities (like, say, northern Egypt or Rio de Janeiro) &ndash; that it makes any sense to spend a lot on such policies as slum clearances, lest the now-teeming city is split apart by crime and grime. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>",
