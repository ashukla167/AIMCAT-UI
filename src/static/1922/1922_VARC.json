Researchers at the University of Washington trained mosquitoes by pairing a mechanical shock created by a vortex mixer - a lab gadget usually used to mix vials of liquid - with the scent of certain animals, like rats or chickens. The mixer simulated the types of vibrations and feelings that might come from a good swatting. Each mosquito had 10 trials lasting 2 minutes each of the vibrating sessions.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">As Joanna Klein reports for <i>T<\/i><i>h<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>N<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>w<\/i><i> <\/i><i>Y<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>k<\/i><i> <\/i><i>T<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i>, after 15 minutes, mosquitoes began to associate the scent of certain animals, including humans, with the shock. They began avoiding the odors associated with the simulated swat, choosing other hosts instead. In fact, the mosquitoes avoided the shock-related scents for at least 24 hours. But for some reason, they never learned to avoid the scent of chickens.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Christopher Potter, a researcher at Johns Hopkins Medicine who was not involved in the study tells George Dvorsky at <i>G<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>z<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>d<\/i><i>o<\/i> that the results seem logical. \u2026 \u201cIt is very plausible that different unpleasant aspects of the swat, such as the rushing feeling of the wind, the banging of the hand close to the mosquito, could then be remembered along with the smell of the person.\u201d\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The researchers also took a much deeper look into the brains of the insects. Previous research has shown that dopamine, a neurotransmitter, plays a key role in learning for other insects and animals. So in a second experiment, the team glued genetically modified mosquitoes that lack dopamine receptors to a device that allows them to fly in place. The researchers then exposed them to scents and the simulated swat while recording the activity of the neurons in the olfactory center of the insects\u2019 brains, which process scent information. Without the help of dopamine, the neurons fired less frequently with the scents, which suggests that the bugs would be less able to learn to avoid odors associated with swats.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So what does that mean in the age-old battle of man versus mosquito? \u201cThat learning ability makes them incredibly flexible,\u201d UW neuroecologist and senior author Jeff Riffell tells Donahue\u2026  As Riffel tells Klein, the knowledge that mosquito learning relies on dopamine could lead to genetic modifications or insecticides that trigger the memory of avoidance, forcing the insects to avoid people.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But any dopamine-based solution will not work on all mosquitoes. For instance, mosquitoes in the genus <i>C<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>x<\/i>, which transmit the West Nile virus, have not shown the same ability to learn to avoid humans as <i>A<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>d<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i>. Because their main host is birds, they likely feed on humans when their preferred host is not available, Walter Leal, chemical ecologist at the University of California at Davis, tells Donahue. Because of this, they likely don\u2019t have receptors for human scents and can\u2019t learn to avoid people. In fact, different mosquitoes have different receptors for preferred hosts, which may be why Riffell\u2019s little bloodsuckers didn\u2019t learn to avoid chickens.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Still, the development of such dopamine-based mosquito deterrents would be a big step. \u201cWe\u2019ve been using all these single-compound repellents for more than 60 years now, and we need to move on,\u201d Leal tells Donahue. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Until then, he suggests another strategy to take advantage of what we now know about the little blood suckers: vigorous swatting.

Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>I<\/b>t is widely agreed that worldwide deforestation is bad for the environment. It is responsible for about 10% of climate-change emissions and leads to massive reductions in biodiversity\u2026 \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">How can we protect forests? One option is direct regulation: in other words the placement of restrictions on road building, the establishment of protected areas, and other such steps. Another option is to impose a fine or tax on forest clearing. Governments can also pay landowners to conserve their forest under a \u201cpayment for ecosystem services\u201d (PES) contract.  It might even be possible to let forest owners trade avoided emissions on a worldwide carbon market, so that forest owners are paid, by those burning fossil fuels, to protect their trees. For sure, there is no shortage of policy options, but what we desperately need is more evidence on how these policies perform in practice.   \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It is extremely difficult to measure the success of such policies. For example, after Brazil tightened regulation and introduced satellite monitoring in the mid-2000s, the Amazon deforestation slowed to about half a million hectares annually. At the same time, falling prices for soybeans and cattle products reduced incentives to clear land. So what was the main factor behind the slowdown? How much forest did the government actually save through regulation and satellite monitoring?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">An allied area that seems equally problematic is how to evaluate the impact of subsidies. Studies of programs in Mexico, Costa Rica and Brazil suggest that PES contracts can halve deforestation rates. They also appear to be much cheaper than, say, establishing protected areas on private land. However, PES subsidies can also waste public money by paying farmers for practices that they would have adopted anyway. After all, farmers who stand to profit the least from cutting down trees are the most likely to sign up for the programme.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Another challenge is identifying \u201cleakage\u201d effects. Some conservation policies, which may be successful locally, can trigger deforestation elsewhere. For example, a farmer may stop clearing forest on plots contracted under a PES programme while increasing deforestation on land not covered by the contract. On a larger scale, the threat of provincial government fines may induce farmers or logging firms to move operations to a neighbouring province.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The gold-standard method of evaluating conservation policies is the systematic use of randomised-controlled trials (RCTs), similar to those used to test pharmaceuticals. RCTs involve randomly selecting two groups of individuals or regions and implementing a policy only for one group, keeping the second as a control. The difference between the groups provides a direct measure of success. Such trials can also be designed to measure leakage.

But autistic children can be difficult to engage with, and their attempts at communication can be so subtle that parents need assistance in detecting them, and advice about how to respond appropriately. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The approach used by PACT involved parents being videoed while playing with their children. Those videos were then replayed to the parents under the tutelage of a speech therapist, who pointed out moments, which might not otherwise have been obvious, when children were attempting to communicate. Even just turning towards a parent may be such an attempt. Having seen when to respond, parents then learned how to do so in the way a therapist would, in order to draw the child out. Parents are thus taught to become therapists themselves. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This therapy, encouragingly, is neither invasive nor intensive nor costly. The results are encouraging. In families who were coached, the percentage of children with severe symptoms (such as having difficulties speaking and learning things) fell from 55% to 46%. In those who formed the control group, and were not so coached, they actually rose - from 50% to 63%. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Yet, in the case of autism, some crucial scientific questions remain to be answered. One of them is how such a therapy might be adopted swiftly and widely - how to spread these methods so that the lives of such children will improve accordingly. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1922_7"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu19":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Consider the following statement: <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><i>R<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>w<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>&#39;<\/i><i>&nbsp;<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>k<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>b<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>t<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>h<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>m<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>l<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>b<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>o<\/i><i>f<\/i><i> <\/i><i>n<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>l<\/i><i> <\/i><i>i<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>d<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>n<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>t<\/i><i> <\/i><i>s<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>g<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>l<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>h<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>t<\/i><i> <\/i><i>h<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>e<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>h<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>b<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>l<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>k<\/i><i> <\/i><i>c<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>p<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>.<\/i><i> <\/i> <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the light of the passage, it can be said that the above statement is <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Definitely true\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Definitely false\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Probably true\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Cannot be determined\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","CORRECT_ANSWER":"a","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"5497","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><i><b> <\/b><\/i><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>9<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>4<\/i><i>:<\/i><i><b> <\/b><\/i>The passage given below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

When we say that a handful of East Village kids started the Hush Puppies epidemic, or that the scattering of the residents of a few housing projects was sufficient to start Baltimore's syphilis epidemic, what we are really saying is that in a given process or system some people matter more than the others.

It was, in fact, the successful brainwashing of captured American troops by the Red Chinese and North Koreans during the Korean conflict that spurred research into \u201cSensory deprivation\u201d. The psychologist D. O. Hebb, a pioneer in this field, found that monotonous sensory stimulation produces confusion - a disruption of the ability to think clearly.
