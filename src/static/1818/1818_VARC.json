His latest contribution to economics includes a &ldquo;meta-model&rdquo; of himself. &ldquo;For more than three decades,&rdquo; he alleges, &ldquo;macroeconomics has gone backwards.&rdquo; Why, his meta-model asks, is he one of the few willing to say so? <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">What Mr Romer says is unusually brutal. After over 30 years of &ldquo;intellectual regress&rdquo;, the study of booms and busts now reminds him of a lipstick-wearing pig. The field is dominated by a tight-knit congregation unified by deference to authority, not facts. Their revered leaders rely on high-handed assumptions to make their models work. But they do not admit to these inadequacies, pretending their naked assumptions are clothed in fine theoretical robes. ... <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The old scientific problem, i.e., identification, besets even the simplest blackboard model of demand and supply, represented in textbooks by two intersecting diagonal lines, one sloping upwards (because sellers supply more when prices are high), the other downwards (because buyers demand more when prices are low). But how do we know a curve&rsquo;s true slope and position? The lines themselves are unobservable. One can only note their intersections, recording each combination of price and quantity, perhaps as dots on a graph. If supply (and only supply) moved randomly, the resulting dots would trace out the demand curve: they would show how much demand expands and contracts when prices fall and rise, thanks to variations in supply. The curve&rsquo;s slope and position would be &ldquo;identified&rdquo;. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But that is not how the world typically works<b>. <\/b>Instead, the pattern of dots will probably reflect shifts in demand as well as supply. That makes it impossible to identify either curve from the dots alone. This identification problem is particularly severe in macroeconomics, which has a lot of moving parts, many of which move each other. To estimate one popular macroeconomic model, an economist must pin down the equivalent of 49 &ldquo;slopes&rdquo;, Mr Romer points out. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Solving this problem is fiendishly difficult. Economists can hunt for scraps of relevant microeconomic evidence, such as household surveys. They can wait for natural experiments. Or they can make flat assumptions: presuming, for example, that the monsoon affects food supply but not demand. Alternatively, they can rely on theory. Through logical reasoning they can try to deduce some law of markets or behaviour (perhaps that pay reflects productivity or that markets clear). Whatever the merit of these deductions, they make it far easier to draw lines through dots. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Indeed, many economists cling to stark, crude theories about market efficiency or rational behaviour precisely because it helps them pin down all those slopes and other parameters. If they did not care about these defining numbers, they could afford to entertain messy, finespun beliefs about human nature and market institutions. But then they would be called sociologists. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The pressures of identification can thus lure macroeconomists into bad or narrow theories. But Mr Romer also accuses them of something worse: hypocrisy and obfuscation. They purport to solve the identification problem by relying on deep theory, but in fact resort to shallow assumptions. Indeed, economists used humbly to admit they had pinned down their models by assuming one thing or another. Now, they do so by theorising one thing or another. But these deductive proofs often rely on earlier, questionable assumptions. In between the assumptions and the proof is enough mathematical &ldquo;blah blah blah&rdquo; (as Mr Romer puts it) to hide the assumptions&rsquo; full role. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Mr Romer says these analytical habits flow from the top.

Several prominent economists have voiced similar doubts about the field. One paper Mr Romer cites is entitled &ldquo;back to square one&rdquo;; another complains about &ldquo;unappealing assumptions&rdquo;.

But how do we know a curve&rsquo;s true slope and position? The lines themselves are unobservable. One can only note their intersections, recording each combination of price and quantity, perhaps as dots on a graph. If supply (and only supply) moved randomly, the resulting dots would trace out the demand curve: they would show how much demand expands and contracts when prices fall and rise, thanks to variations in supply.

Ideology in this sense is not restricted to the secular and explicit political doctrines we usually associate with the term, but can include religion, culture, and the complex of moral values underlying any society as well. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Hegel&quot;s view of the relationship between the ideal and the real or material worlds was an extremely complicated one, beginning with the fact that for him the distinction between the two was only apparent. He did not believe that the real world conformed or could be made to conform to ideological preconceptions of philosophy professors in any simpleminded way, or that the &quot;material&quot; world could not impinge on the ideal. While Hegel&quot;s writing and thinking could be <b>stopped <\/b><b>by <\/b><b>a <\/b><b>bullet <\/b><b>from <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>material <\/b><b>world<\/b><b>, <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>hand <\/b><b>on <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>trigger <\/b><b>of <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>gun <\/b><b>was <\/b><b>motivated <\/b><b>in <\/b><b>turn <\/b><b>by <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>ideas <\/b><b>of <\/b><b>liberty <\/b><b>and <\/b><b>equality <\/b>that had driven the French Revolution. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">For Hegel, all human behavior in the material world, and hence all human history, is rooted in a prior state of consciousness. This consciousness may not be explicit and self-aware, as are modern political doctrines, but may rather take the form of religion or simple cultural or moral habits. And yet this realm of consciousness in the long run necessarily becomes manifest in the material world, indeed creates the material world in its own image. Consciousness is cause and not effect, and can develop autonomously from the material world; hence the real subtext underlying the apparent jumble of current events is the history of ideology. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Hegel&quot;s idealism has fared poorly at the hands of later thinkers. Marx reversed the priority of the real and the ideal completely, relegating the entire realm of consciousness &ndash; religion, art, culture, philosophy itself &ndash; to a &quot;superstructure&quot; that was determined entirely by the prevailing material mode of production. Yet another unfortunate legacy of Marxism is our tendency to retreat into materialist or utilitarian explanations of political or historical phenomena, and our disinclination to believe in the autonomous power of ideas. Paul Kennedy ascribed the decline of great powers to simple economic overextension. Obviously, this is true on some level: an empire whose economy is barely above the level of subsistence cannot bankrupt its treasury indefinitely. But whether a highly productive modern industrial society chooses to spend 3 or 7 percent of its GNP on defence rather than consumption is entirely a matter of that society&quot;s political priorities, which are in turn determined in the realm of consciousness. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The materialist bias of modern thought is characteristic not only of people on the Left who may be sympathetic to Marxism, but of many passionate anti-Marxists as well. Indeed, there is on the Right what one might label the Wall Street Journal school of deterministic materialism that discounts the importance of ideology and culture and sees man as essentially a rational, profit-maximizing individual. But one small example will illustrate the problematic character of such materialist views. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Max Weber begins his famous book, <i>The <\/i><i>Protestant <\/i><i>Ethic <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>the <\/i><i>Spirit <\/i><i>of <\/i><i>Capitalism<\/i>, by noting the different economic performance of Protestant and Catholic communities throughout Europe and America, summed up in the proverb that Protestants eat well while Catholics sleep well. Weber noted that in many traditional peasant communities, raising the piece-work rate had the opposite effect of <i>lowering <\/i>labor productivity: at the higher rate, a peasant accustomed to earning two and one-half marks per day found he could earn the same amount by working less, and did so because he valued leisure more than income. The choices of leisure over income, or of the militaristic life of the Spartan hoplite over the wealth of the Athenian trader, or even the ascetic life of the early capitalist entrepreneur over that of a traditional leisured aristocrat, cannot possibly be explained by the impersonal working of material forces, but come preeminently out of the sphere of consciousness. A central theme of Weber&quot;s work was to prove that contrary to Marx, the material mode of production, far from being the &quot;base,&quot; was itself a &quot;superstructure&quot; with roots in religion and culture, and that to understand the emergence of modern capitalism and the profit motive one had to study their antecedents in the realm of the spirit. <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1818_B"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu8":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><b><\/b>According to the passage, which of the following examples of decision choices can be said to be determined in the realm of consciousness?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Identify all that apply and enter the corresponding number in the input box given below.

Ideology in this sense is not restricted to the secular and explicit political doctrines we usually associate with the term, but can include religion, culture, and the complex of moral values underlying any society as well. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Hegel&quot;s view of the relationship between the ideal and the real or material worlds was an extremely complicated one, beginning with the fact that for him the distinction between the two was only apparent. He did not believe that the real world conformed or could be made to conform to ideological preconceptions of philosophy professors in any simpleminded way, or that the &quot;material&quot; world could not impinge on the ideal. While Hegel&quot;s writing and thinking could be <b>stopped <\/b><b>by <\/b><b>a <\/b><b>bullet <\/b><b>from <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>material <\/b><b>world<\/b><b>, <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>hand <\/b><b>on <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>trigger <\/b><b>of <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>gun <\/b><b>was <\/b><b>motivated <\/b><b>in <\/b><b>turn <\/b><b>by <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>ideas <\/b><b>of <\/b><b>liberty <\/b><b>and <\/b><b>equality <\/b>that had driven the French Revolution. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">For Hegel, all human behavior in the material world, and hence all human history, is rooted in a prior state of consciousness. This consciousness may not be explicit and self-aware, as are modern political doctrines, but may rather take the form of religion or simple cultural or moral habits. And yet this realm of consciousness in the long run necessarily becomes manifest in the material world, indeed creates the material world in its own image. Consciousness is cause and not effect, and can develop autonomously from the material world; hence the real subtext underlying the apparent jumble of current events is the history of ideology. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Hegel&quot;s idealism has fared poorly at the hands of later thinkers. Marx reversed the priority of the real and the ideal completely, relegating the entire realm of consciousness &ndash; religion, art, culture, philosophy itself &ndash; to a &quot;superstructure&quot; that was determined entirely by the prevailing material mode of production. Yet another unfortunate legacy of Marxism is our tendency to retreat into materialist or utilitarian explanations of political or historical phenomena, and our disinclination to believe in the autonomous power of ideas. Paul Kennedy ascribed the decline of great powers to simple economic overextension. Obviously, this is true on some level: an empire whose economy is barely above the level of subsistence cannot bankrupt its treasury indefinitely. But whether a highly productive modern industrial society chooses to spend 3 or 7 percent of its GNP on defence rather than consumption is entirely a matter of that society&quot;s political priorities, which are in turn determined in the realm of consciousness. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The materialist bias of modern thought is characteristic not only of people on the Left who may be sympathetic to Marxism, but of many passionate anti-Marxists as well. Indeed, there is on the Right what one might label the Wall Street Journal school of deterministic materialism that discounts the importance of ideology and culture and sees man as essentially a rational, profit-maximizing individual. But one small example will illustrate the problematic character of such materialist views. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Max Weber begins his famous book, <i>The <\/i><i>Protestant <\/i><i>Ethic <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>the <\/i><i>Spirit <\/i><i>of <\/i><i>Capitalism<\/i>, by noting the different economic performance of Protestant and Catholic communities throughout Europe and America, summed up in the proverb that Protestants eat well while Catholics sleep well. Weber noted that in many traditional peasant communities, raising the piece-work rate had the opposite effect of <i>lowering <\/i>labor productivity: at the higher rate, a peasant accustomed to earning two and one-half marks per day found he could earn the same amount by working less, and did so because he valued leisure more than income. The choices of leisure over income, or of the militaristic life of the Spartan hoplite over the wealth of the Athenian trader, or even the ascetic life of the early capitalist entrepreneur over that of a traditional leisured aristocrat, cannot possibly be explained by the impersonal working of material forces, but come preeminently out of the sphere of consciousness. A central theme of Weber&quot;s work was to prove that contrary to Marx, the material mode of production, far from being the &quot;base,&quot; was itself a &quot;superstructure&quot; with roots in religion and culture, and that to understand the emergence of modern capitalism and the profit motive one had to study their antecedents in the realm of the spirit. <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1818_B"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu13":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'>According to the passage, why are customers undeterred by the name of the restaurant?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>The restaurant is the front end of the laboratory.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>People working in the laboratory also worked as chefs in restaurants in Ginza.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>The laboratory provided the cherished farmed bluefin tuna required by the restaurant in Ginza.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>The laboratory supplied bluefin tuna illegally even though the Japanese government banned the fishing of the same.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"c","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"3424","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>13 <\/i><i>to <\/i><i>15<\/i><i>: <\/i>The passage given below is followed by a set of three questions.

To succeed today, he must embellish it. Particularly if he wants to be President. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">&ldquo;Potential presidents are measured against an ideal that&rsquo;s a combination of leading man, God, father, hero, pope, king, with maybe just a touch of the avenging Furies thrown in,&rdquo; an adviser to Richard Nixon wrote in a memorandum late in 1967. Then, perhaps, aware that Nixon qualified only as father, he discussed improvements that would have to be made- not upon Nixon himself, but upon the image of him which was received by the voter. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">That there is a difference between the individual and his image is human nature. Or American nature, at least.

Since the first encounter between Amerindians (American Indian peoples) and the Spanish conquistadors, in the southern part of the continent (during the late fifteenth century), to the large-scale white settlement, the slave trade and massive population movements of the eighteenth, and particularly the nineteenth centuries, American culture and ethnicity have been drawn from the four corners of the globe. The opening lines of the historian&rsquo;s Oscar Handlin&rsquo;s classic work, <i>The <\/i><i>Uprooted<\/i><i>: <\/i><i>The <\/i><i>Epic <\/i><i>History <\/i><i>of <\/i><i>the <\/i><i>Great <\/i><i>Migrations <\/i><i>that <\/i><i>Made <\/i><i>the <\/i><i>American <\/i><i>People <\/i>(1977 edn.), sum up the importance of this dimension of the history of the USA: &lsquo;Once I thought to write a history of the immigrants in America.

At the same time, Europe&rsquo;s regions, small nations and languages look to the EU to protect and advance their precious cultural inheritance or what can be defined thus. Support for the small ethnic groups of Europe, from the Scottish Highlands, to Wales, to Catalonia, has resulted in increased funding opportunities for cultural activities, including native-tongue radio and television broadcasting and historical research. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The history of Britain over the past century or so has encouraged the study of ethnicity. Why? The primary reason is mass immigration. Since the 1840s, when Irish settlements in Britain reached major proportions due to the Great Famine (1845-52) the scale, pace and diversity of immigration have been considerable. In the later 19<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup> century, Irish settlers were matched by the arrival of Jews from eastern Europe, including those fleeing the Tsarist pogroms of the 1890s. In the late 20<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup> century, these predominantly white movements were surpassed by what was dubbed &lsquo;New Commonwealth&rsquo; immigration: settlers originating in Africa, the Indian subcontinent and West Indies. It would be misleading to see immigration as a purely modern development. In the early 18<sup>t<\/sup><sup>h<\/sup> century Defoe described England as a &lsquo;Mongrel Nation&rsquo;. Recent history requires that scholars and students alike come to terms with the variety of our cultural and ethnic heritage. The idea of one history for one people (implicitly a white history for white people) has gone.

Study of our clearly ethnically mixed recent history has been limited next to the American example. In fact, more words have been written on any one ethnic group in the USA &ndash; say Italian or Irish &ndash; than has been given over to all settlers in Britain since the 1840s. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The term &lsquo;ethnicity&rsquo; questions dominant and received wisdoms.

Even the boss of one, Credit Suisse, has described them as \u201cnot really investable\u201d, and, sure enough, shares in many of the most prominent firms \u2013 Deutsche Bank, Citigroup, Bank of America \u2013 trade well below book value, suggesting they would be better off liquidated.

And although these are indeed only metaphors, they do reflect an underlying attitude \u2013 that it is the clinician\u2019s job to attack and destroy his patient\u2019s tumour directly, with whatever weapons are to hand. ________________(2)______________ As in real warfare, those weapons may be conventional (surgery), chemical (cancer-killing drugs) or nuclear (radiation therapy). There is even talk of biological agents, in the form of viruses specifically tailored to seek out and eliminate their tumorous targets. ________________(3)______________ But as Sun Tzu observed, the wisest general is not one who wins one hundred victories in one hundred battles, but rather one who overcomes the armies of his enemies without having to fight them himself. ________________(4)______________ And one way to do that is to get someone else to do your fighting for you. That, in an oncological context, is where immunotherapy comes in: it recruits a patient\u2019s immune system to do the attacking.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"3","CORRECT_ANSWER":"3","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"2","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"0","TIME":"0"}}
