In all speech, Ben Johnson wrote, words and sense are as the body and soul. The sense is as the life and soul of language without which all words are dead. The dualism of body and soul may be unfashionable but the dualism of which Johnson speaks, the dualism of words and sense, is the one we cannot do without. To a human, meaning is everything.

Understanding this linguistic translation makes it possible for us to employ a social aesthetics reading of the claims in the history of American musical production that otherwise seem unmotivated. John Coltrane\u2019s rejection of the label \u201cjazz\u201d for his music, and his preference for labeling jazz \u201cAmerica\u2019s classical music\u201d can be interpreted as a contestation of the class position to which jazz musicians and their art-making had to be relegated. This contestation does not achieve the relativism of Bourdieu\u2019s inventory, but it does underscore the connection between social identity and aesthetic taste.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1810"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu13":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>3<\/i>:<b> <\/b>The sentences given below, when properly sequenced, form a coherent paragraph.

Confucius held that when words go wrong, there is no limit to what else may go wrong with them; \u201cthe civilized person is anything but casual in what he says.\u201d This view is often associated with pessimism about the usefulness of natural language as a tool for acquiring knowledge; it has also inspired efforts by some philosophers and linguists to construct an \u201cideal\u201d language, one that would be semantically or logically \u201ctransparent.\u201d Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz envisioned\u00a0a \u201cuniversal characteristic\u201d that would enable people to settle their disputes through a process of pure calculation,\u00a0analogous\u00a0to the factoring of numbers. The rapid development of modern mathematical logic similarly inspired the idea of a language in which grammatical form would be a sure guide to meaning, so that the inferences that could legitimately be drawn from propositions would be clearly visible on their surface.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Outside philosophy there have often been calls for replacing specialized professional idioms with \u201cplain\u201d language, which is always presumed to be free of obscurity and therefore immune to abuse. George Orwell, initially an enthusiast, turned against the idea in his novel 1984, which featured the thought-controlling \u201cNewspeak.\u201d Yet he continued to hold the doubtful ideal of a language as \u201cclear as a windowpane,\u201d through which facts would transparently reveal themselves.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1810"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu27":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>7<\/i>:<b> <\/b>The following question has a paragraph from which a sentence has been left incomplete.

Physics deals with the external world of matter, space and time, from the giant galaxies in outer space down to the infinitesimally small particles which make up the atom. Meditation looks inward; its domain is that which is not physical. When we close our eyes during meditation, we are cutting off the senses which connect us with the physical world. ____________________________________.
