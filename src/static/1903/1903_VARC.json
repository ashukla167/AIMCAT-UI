If literature seems a pompous word, let&#39;s say entertainment. The appetite to read about art is almost as insatiable as the need to look at it; the critic provides a service that gives a chance to talk, think and tell stories about art and artists.

The truth is that critics have been in retreat for a long time. In British art, they faced a cataclysmic loss of standing just before I came on the scene. When I was a student, the art critic whose books I bought was Peter Fuller, founder of the magazine Modern Painters and a savage critic of most trends in contemporary art. I enjoyed the provocative seriousness of his essays. I also loved the writing of Robert Hughes, another critic whose eloquence was - and is - very much at the expense of current art. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Not much newspaper criticism comes near their mark, but what critics did share, in the late 1980s, was a similar scepticism about new fashions, a &quot;seriousness&quot; defined by suspicion. And of course, history played a joke on these critics - even on Fuller and Hughes. While high moral disdain for shallow modern art was pouring from the printing presses, a generation of British artists led by Damien Hirst were getting away with anything they wanted - again and again and again. Words were crushed by images. Critics were reduced to the status of promoters. They had no other role. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Today I think there is an opportunity for critics again - and a need. The sheer volume and range of art that we&#39;re fed in a culture obsessed with galleries is so vast and confusing that a critic can get stuck in and make a difference. It really is time to stand up for what is good against what is meretricious. And it really is possible to find examples of excellence as well as stupidity. In other words, this is a great time to be a critic - to try to show people what really matters. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Yes, there&#39;s a staggering volume of mediocre art being talked up by fools. But there are real talents and real ideas too. The critic&#39;s task is to identify what is good and defend it come hell or high water - and to honestly denounce the bad. Art history can help in this task by enriching your perspective. Writing can give you a flexibility in how and when you want to engage. But engage we must.

And of course, history played a joke on these critics - even on Fuller and Hughes. While high moral disdain for shallow modern art was pouring from the printing presses, a generation of British artists led by Damien Hirst were getting away with anything they wanted - again and again and again.

As with wine, the processing of coffee beans and cacao, used to make chocolate, also requires some fermentation. Cacao originated in the Amazon and was widely cultivated in Central America before Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s brought it to the Old World in 1530. From Ethiopia, coffee was disseminated throughout the Middle East by Arab traders during the 6th century and it ultimately arrived in the New World during the 17th century. Over the next three centuries, other trading nations completed coffee\u2019s worldwide dissemination and set it up as a mainstay crop of many of the world\u2019s poorest economies.

Leaving aside the fact that the whole of agriculture is unnatural, this is still an odd worry. It has been known for a while that some genes move from one species to another given the chance, in a process called horizontal gene transfer. Genes for antibiotic resistance, for example, swap freely between species of bacteria. Only recently, though, it has become clear just how wide-spread such natural transgenics is. _______________________________________\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<ol><li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Flies and worms are among geneticists' favourite animals, so lots of data have been collected on them.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span><\/li>\n<li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The natural technology can help feed people in developing countries, keep our food costs as low as possible and aid the environment by reducing our carbon footprint and reducing soil erosion.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span><\/li>\n<li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>What was once regarded as a peculiarity of lesser organisms has now been found to be true in human beings, too.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span><\/li>\n<li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>But it might surprise many people that they are even to a small degree part bacterium, part fungus and part alga.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span><\/li>\n<li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>That has led to debates over whether genetically modified organisms should be labelled or tightly regulated.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>","OPT1":"3","CORRECT_ANSWER":"3","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"2","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"0","TIME":"0"},"qu30":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b> <i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>9<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i>1<\/i>:<i> <\/i>Each of the following questions has a paragraph from which the last sentence has been left incomplete.

Signs of anti-Jewish bias were emerging in Berlin against Jews in general and against Einstein, the new celebrity, in particular. Part of the prejudice appeared in the form of outrageous criticisms against relativity theory - which anti-Semites, particularly German physicists Philipp Lenard and Johannes Stark, both of whom had won the Nobel Prize, referred to as \u201cJewish science\u201d.

That writing system, invented by the Sumerians, emerged in Mesopotamia around 3500 BCE. At first, this writing was representational: a bull might be represented by a picture of a bull, and a pictograph of barley signified the word barley. Though writing began as pictures, this system was inconvenient for conveying anything other than simple nouns, and it became increasingly abstract as it evolved to encompass more abstract concepts, eventually taking form in the world\u2019s earliest writing: cuneiform. An increasingly complex civilization encouraged the development of an increasingly sophisticated form of writing. _______________________________________\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<ol><li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The ability to decipher these symbols and signs was seen as an extraordinary accomplishment.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span><\/li>\n<li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Egyptian hieroglyphics were thought to possess magical powers and, to this day, many readers regard these sources as media for gaining cultural and spiritual experiences.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span><\/li>\n<li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Writing has always been a marker of character, which is why people throughout history have invested considerable cultural and emotional resources in cultivating identities as lovers of books.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span><\/li>\n<li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Since the invention of the cuneiform system of writing in Mesopotamia and of hieroglyphics in Egypt, the serious reader of texts has enjoyed cultural acclamation.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span><\/li>\n<li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Cuneiform came to function both phonetically (representing a sound) and semantically (representing a meaning such as an object or concept) rather than only representing objects directly as a picture.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span><\/li>\n<\/ol>","OPT1":"5","CORRECT_ANSWER":"5","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"2","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"0","TIME":"0"},"qu32":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b> <i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i>2<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i>4<\/i>: Each of the following questions presents a sentence, part or all of which is underlined.
