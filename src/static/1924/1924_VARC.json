Like many before him, he was sceptical of a purely objective view of reality. He didn\u2019t buy into the idea of a preordained purpose. Nor did he think that the answer was obvious. After all, there is a lot that doesn\u2019t make sense about life, and this lack of orientation isn\u2019t always pleasant. In fact, quite often, it involves pain, confusion, and sustained difficulty.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Camus goes on to talk about all of this at length, and he eventually answers the question. At the end of the essay, he frames his conclusion into the story of Sisyphus, a character in Greek mythology who disobeyed the Gods and was punished to pointlessly roll a boulder up a hill for eternity, only to watch it fall right back down, forcing him to repeat the task.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cIt is during that return, that pause, that Sisyphus interests me\u2026 I see that man going back down with a heavy yet measured step toward the torment of which he will never know the end\u2026 At each of those moments when he leaves the heights and gradually sinks toward the lairs of the gods, he is superior to his fate. He is stronger than his rock\u2026One always finds one\u2019s burden again. But Sisyphus teaches the higher fidelity that negates the gods and raises rocks. He too concludes that all is well. This universe henceforth without a master seems to him neither sterile nor futile. Each atom of that stone, each mineral flake of that night filled mountain, in itself forms a world. The struggle itself toward the heights is enough to fill a man\u2019s heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy.\u201d The essay ends as shockingly as it began. How is it possible for Sisyphus to be happy?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Before we answer that, we have to first introduce the problem that Camus was trying to solve. It\u2019s one that takes shape in different forms in every life that has ever been lived.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The absurd condition is a product of us trying to reason with an unreasonable world. It occurs when our rational and sensible ideas about what we want out of life collide with the cold indifference of an unsympathetic world that doesn\u2019t concern itself with any one person. Many of us would like to work jobs that ignite our imagination every day, but instead, we\u2019re stuck doing repetitive chores so we can pay the bills and keep doing more of the same. A lot of us would like a reasonable shot at contentment and fulfilment, but due to things mostly outside of our control, we are instead forced to deal with disorientation and confusion. Our expectations aren\u2019t unreasonable nor do they fall outside of the realm of possibility. Yet, due to factors larger than any one of us, we have to settle.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">There are two obvious solutions. The first is to abandon our reasonable expectations, and the second is to pretend that the world isn\u2019t unreasonable at all and that everything is fine. These solutions to the predicament, however, don\u2019t please Camus.

Physics deals with the external world of matter, space and time, from the giant galaxies in outer space down to the infinitesimally small particles which make up the atom. Meditation looks inward; its domain is that which is not physical. When we close our eyes in meditation, we are cutting off the senses which connect us with the physical world. We are investigating the nature of the inner consciousness which makes us alive, alert and aware of the world around us. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In the 1920s, quantum physics, through its revelations, was turning the world of science upside down - that light was both a particle and a wave, that there no longer was a strict relation between cause and effect and that it was impossible to measure both the position and the speed of a particle at the same time. Moreover, quantum theory was unable to predict the outcome of an experiment. If there were, for example, two possible results of an experimental measurement - say A and B - quantum theory could do no more than state the probability that a given measurement would turn up as A or B; it could not predict what the actual result would be. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This problem was tackled by a mathematical physicist, John von Neumann, who reasoned that whatever was responsible for choosing the outcome of a measurement had to be something which was not governed by the quantum theory, and therefore had to be non-physical. He reasoned that all of the visible components in an experiment were physical. The only non-physical element in the experimental set-up was the consciousness of the human being performing the measurement. If the experiment were performed, common sense would prevail and only one result, either A or B, would be found. Von Neumann had thus discovered consciousness as a vital ingredient in a quantum experiment. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It is here in consciousness that physics and meditation meet.

They had always joked that PhDs in Marine Science didn&#39;t necessarily know how to fish. ... A historic ruling by U.S. Federal District Court Judge Gladys Kessler pushing the deadline for implementation of Amendment 13, which would set catch limits on specific New England groundfish species, back from August 22, 2003 to May 1, 2004, was thus seen as a welcome move by US fishermen. The decision was also a victory for several environmental groups who had asked that the rules be delayed by nine months in order for the public to better understand the science behind the restrictions. The decision did not, however, change the court&#39;s 2009 deadline for rebuilding groundfish stocks. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Groundfish are species such as cod, haddock, flounder that feed close to the bottom of the ocean from the Canadian border to Cape Hatteras. The judge&#39;s decision was only the latest legal ruling in a battle for the future of New England groundfish. Studies at that time indicated that 18 of 20 New England groundfish species were below healthy population levels. Twelve of these species were at less than half of their sustainable population levels and eight species were at less than one-fourth of such levels. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Amendment 13 was itself the product of a December 2001 ruling that the plan to manage New England groundfish was not complying with the law. The court had set the August 2003 deadline for the onset of Amendment 13, which provided a framework for overfishing and bycatch, as well as to set catch limits on specific New England groundfish species. The lawsuit that successfully moved this date to May 2004 came in the wake of industry allegations that government scientists had relied on flawed sampling data techniques to collect data for the new groundfish regulations. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In September 2002, a few scientists belonging to the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) discovered that the NOAA&#39;s ship Albatross IV, which was employed to collect data on New England groundfish, had done so with mismarked cables, leaving some concerned that the net was set at an angle. The mismarking was on the cable used to deploy and haul back the survey trawl net on the Albatross. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This caused some tows to be deployed with more cable out on one side of the net than the other, according to the NMFS. The gear configuration affected eight resource surveys conducted between the winter of 2000 and the spring of 2002. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fishing industry called the findings &quot;trawlgate&quot; and challenged the survey data, arguing that this configuration allowed fish to escape, resulting in undercounted stocks and restrictions that were tighter than necessary. Lobbyists for the industry had called for at least a two year delay to fully probe what they deem to be questionable science. They wanted to conduct workshops that fostered further discussion of the impending restrictions and the groundfish conservation steps that would be required. Opponents of Amendment 13 believed that the restrictions could be devastating to the livelihoods of local fishermen. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">NMFS completed an additional survey that included side-by-side comparisons of fishing by the Albatross and another vessel. The survey, named Northeast Area Monitoring and Assessment Program, was developed to augment NOAA surveys in the shallow waters between 3 and 4 four miles offshore between Cape Cod and Cape Hatteras. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Captain Jim Ruhle&rsquo;s boat, F\/V Darana R, with a full crew of scientists from the Virginia Institute of Marine Science, documented numbers of fish that would seem unlikely to people who believed that the oceans were nearly fished out. Mr. Ruhle took the Darana R into 60 feet of water just north of Montauk. Using an otter trawl with six sensors which made sure it was properly deployed, he manned the helm and counted the number of skates he caught while fishing right next to NOAA&rsquo;s Albatross IV, which had the same rig and sampling instructions as his own boat. He caught 54 times the number of skate that the Albatross IV caught, he said. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1924_3"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu22":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Which literary device is employed in: .... as does a costly vase, long buried in the earth, which is found to have a flaw when it is dug up once more.

In the funny, subtle and strangely moving fable &#39;Memoirs of a Polar Bear&#39;, Yoko Tawada, a Japanese-born author who has lived in Germany since 1982, gives a startling answer about the bonds that unite, and the gulfs that divide, humans and animals. Leaving her son &ldquo;wasn&#39;t an easy decision&rdquo;, writes Knut&#39;s mother Tosca, &ldquo;but because of my literary work I didn&#39;t have enough time for him.&rdquo; Besides, &ldquo;historical greatness&rdquo; beckoned her little beast. ______________________________________________<\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Poster-bear for climate change, Knut endures celebrity as the frail focus of \u201cbillions of worried eyes.\u201d\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Ms Tawada gives three separate memoirs from a talented dynasty of bears. \r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Ms Tawada respects the actual behaviour of bears even as her ursine authors inspect the vanity of humankind through an outsider's or migrant's eyes.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Knut became a furry emblem of the dangers of global warming and the struggle for conservation.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","CORRECT_ANSWER":"d","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu26":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<strong>DIRECTIONS <\/strong><em>for questions 25 and 26<\/em>: The following question has a paragraph from which the last sentence has been left incomplete.

It&#39;s not just that it&#39;s a stretch to imagine how our sleep connects us to other times and places; it&#39;s that we&#39;re not even there when it happens. Dreaming is a possible exception, since it&#39;s sometimes recoverable by our waking selves, which is part of why dreaming has a much longer historiography than the other 85% of the sleep cycle. But the other aspects of the sleeping self, characterized by non-productivity, maddening lumpishness, and obliviousness, are about as unavailable to us as is being born or dying. _________________________<\/font><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">___<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">___<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">___<\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>When do sleeping arrangements or patterns of sleep or inequities in the social distribution of sleep become notable and contested?\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Doesn't this interaction of the repetitive and the rhythmic sooner or later give rise to the dispossession of the body? \r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>That is the challenge that a new subfield of humanities and social science - work on the sociocultural meanings of sleep we might call critical sleep studies - has taken up.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Everything you thought couldn\u2019t have a history now has one.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","CORRECT_ANSWER":"c","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu27":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>7<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>9<\/i><i>:<\/i><i> <\/i>The following question has five sentences.
