If most people sitting at the terminal cannot get this right most of the time, then the computer is judged to have passed the Turing test.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">It is worth remembering that Turing wrote this paper only two years after the world\u2019s first operational electronic stored-program computer ran its first program in Manchester, on June 21, 1948. Indeed, it was this machine that brought Turing to Manchester, and it was during his time here that he wrote this paper. Turing thought that all that a machine would require to pass his test was more memory - the 1948 Manchester \u2018Baby\u2019 was quite powerful enough already. He estimated that a gigabyte (a thousand million bytes) of memory should suffice, and this should be achievable by the end of the twentieth century.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">By the beginning of the 21st century computers did, indeed, typically have a gigabyte of memory, and they were a million times faster than the \u2018Baby\u2019, but still they could not pass his test. Even today, with still far more computing power and memory, no machine has convincingly passed the test. This would have surprised Turing had he lived to see it.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">Although research into artificial intelligence (AI) has delivered in many areas of life - think of Google, talking to your smartphone, driverless cars, and so on, it has failed to deliver as expected, particularly by many imaginative science fiction writers, in the area known as Artificial General Intelligence. This is the idea that a suitably programmed machine might display aspects of intelligence that we normally associate only with humans. My take on the failure to deliver this form of AI is that we have never actually worked out what natural intelligence is, so we don\u2019t know what it is that we are trying to imitate in our machines.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\">As a result, in my research I have gone back to the source of human intelligence \u2212 the human brain and tried to see how we might use computers to better understand this mysterious organ upon which we all so critically depend.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\">This line of thinking has led to the development of the SpiNNaker machine \u2212 shorthand for Spiking Neural Network architecture.

These rates do not bode well for the future of life on our planet, but what if extinction wasn\u2019t permanent? What if we could resurrect some of the species we\u2019ve lost? The two animals at the forefront of this discussion are the woolly mammoth, a hairy, close relative of the elephant that lived in the Arctic, and the passenger pigeon, a small, gray bird with a pinkish red breast once extremely common in North America. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">There are three main approaches to de-extinction scientists talk about. The first, called backbreeding, involves finding living species that have traits similar to the extinct species. Then scientists would selectively breed these animals to try to make a version that more closely resembles the extinct animal \u2013 a process already underway for some extinct species like aurochs. This isn\u2019t really a true de-extinction, but it might still let us fill in missing ecological functions. In the case of mammoths, scientists might try to mate Asian elephants with more body hair than usual, for example.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">A second option is cloning. Scientists would take a preserved cell from a recently extinct animal (ideally before the last of its kind died) and extract the nucleus. They would then swap this nucleus into an egg cell from the animal\u2019s closest living relative and implant the egg into a surrogate host. (Researchers actually did this in 2007, and a common goat gave birth to an extinct species, the <i>Pyrenean <\/i><i>ibex<\/i>. The infant lived only 7 minutes however, because of genetic problems with its lungs.) Cloning may eventually give us basically identical genetic copies of extinct species, but we\u2019ll be restricted to animals that went extinct more recently and have well-preserved cells with intact nuclei. The mammoth and the passenger pigeon may never be cloned.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">The newest option is genetic engineering. Here, researchers would line up the genome of an extinct animal with that of its closest living relative. They would then use CRISPR and other gene-editing tools to swap relevant genes from the extinct animal into the living species and implant the hybrid genome into a surrogate (or grow it in an artificial womb). This approach doesn\u2019t produce genetically identical copies of extinct animals, but rather modern versions of an animal engineered to look and behave like its extinct relatives.

Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\">Earth is in the midst of its sixth mass extinction: Somewhere between 30 and 159 species disappear every day, thanks largely to humans, and more than 300 types of mammals, birds, reptiles, and amphibians have vanished since 1500. These rates do not bode well for the future of life on our planet, but what if extinction wasn\u2019t permanent? What if we could resurrect some of the species we\u2019ve lost? The two animals at the forefront of this discussion are the woolly mammoth, a hairy, close relative of the elephant that lived in the Arctic, and the passenger pigeon, a small, gray bird with a pinkish red breast once extremely common in North America. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">There are three main approaches to de-extinction scientists talk about. The first, called backbreeding, involves finding living species that have traits similar to the extinct species. Then scientists would selectively breed these animals to try to make a version that more closely resembles the extinct animal \u2013 a process already underway for some extinct species like aurochs. This isn\u2019t really a true de-extinction, but it might still let us fill in missing ecological functions. In the case of mammoths, scientists might try to mate Asian elephants with more body hair than usual, for example.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">A second option is cloning. Scientists would take a preserved cell from a recently extinct animal (ideally before the last of its kind died) and extract the nucleus. They would then swap this nucleus into an egg cell from the animal\u2019s closest living relative and implant the egg into a surrogate host. (Researchers actually did this in 2007, and a common goat gave birth to an extinct species, the <i>Pyrenean <\/i><i>ibex<\/i>. The infant lived only 7 minutes however, because of genetic problems with its lungs.) Cloning may eventually give us basically identical genetic copies of extinct species, but we\u2019ll be restricted to animals that went extinct more recently and have well-preserved cells with intact nuclei. The mammoth and the passenger pigeon may never be cloned.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">The newest option is genetic engineering. Here, researchers would line up the genome of an extinct animal with that of its closest living relative. They would then use CRISPR and other gene-editing tools to swap relevant genes from the extinct animal into the living species and implant the hybrid genome into a surrogate (or grow it in an artificial womb). This approach doesn\u2019t produce genetically identical copies of extinct animals, but rather modern versions of an animal engineered to look and behave like its extinct relatives. This is the technology being used by the mammoth and passenger pigeon groups.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

Theresa May, Andy Burnham and Nicola Sturgeon have all claimed that the publication was undermining the pursuit of the criminals responsible.

The British police have stopped sharing their information on the Manchester bombing with their American counterparts. The damage to trust is real.

The US media had published stories based on leaked British police investigations after the 7\/7 London bombings in 2005.

Driven from their homes by unsatisfactory economic opportunities and harsh segregationist laws, many blacks headed north, where they took advantage of the need for industrial workers that first arose during the First World War. ...\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">After the post-Civil War Reconstruction period ended in 1876, white supremacy was largely restored across the South, and the segregationist policies known as Jim Crow soon became the law of the land. ... The Ku Klux Klan continued underground even after its official dissolution in 1869, and intimidation, violence and lynching of black southerners were common in the Jim Crow South.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">After World War I broke out in Europe in 1914, industrialized urban areas in the North, Midwest and West faced a shortage of industrial laborers, as the war put an end to the steady tide of European immigration to the United States. With war production kicking into high gear, recruiters enticed African Americans to come north, where the factory wage was typically three times more than what blacks could expect to make by working the land in the rural South.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\"> By the end of 1919, some 1 million blacks had left the South. In the decade between 1910 and 1920, the black population of major Northern cities including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit grew by large percentages. Many new arrivals found jobs in factories, slaughterhouses and foundries, where working conditions were arduous and sometimes dangerous. Female migrants had a harder time finding work, spurring heated competition for domestic labor positions.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">Aside from competition for employment, there was also competition for living space in the increasingly crowded cities. While segregation was not legalized in the North (as it was in the South), racism and prejudice were widespread. After the U.S. Supreme Court declared racially based housing ordinances unconstitutional in 1917, some residential neighborhoods enacted covenants requiring white property owners to agree not to sell to blacks; these would remain legal until the Court struck them down in 1948.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">As a result of housing tensions, many blacks ended up creating their own cities within big cities, fostering the growth of a new urban African-American culture. The most prominent example was Harlem in New York City, a formerly all-white neighborhood that by the 1920s housed some 200,000 African Americans. The black experience during the Great Migration became an important theme in the artistic movement known first as the New Negro Movement and later as the Harlem Renaissance, which would have an enormous impact on the culture of the era.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

The Ku Klux Klan continued underground even after its official dissolution in 1869, and intimidation, violence and lynching of black southerners were common in the Jim Crow South.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">After World War I broke out in Europe in 1914, industrialized urban areas in the North, Midwest and West faced a shortage of industrial laborers, as the war put an end to the steady tide of European immigration to the United States. With war production kicking into high gear, recruiters enticed African Americans to come north, where the factory wage was typically three times more than what blacks could expect to make by working the land in the rural South.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\"> By the end of 1919, some 1 million blacks had left the South. In the decade between 1910 and 1920, the black population of major Northern cities including New York, Chicago, Philadelphia and Detroit grew by large percentages. Many new arrivals found jobs in factories, slaughterhouses and foundries, where working conditions were arduous and sometimes dangerous. Female migrants had a harder time finding work, spurring heated competition for domestic labor positions.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">Aside from competition for employment, there was also competition for living space in the increasingly crowded cities. While segregation was not legalized in the North (as it was in the South), racism and prejudice were widespread. After the U.S. Supreme Court declared racially based housing ordinances unconstitutional in 1917, some residential neighborhoods enacted covenants requiring white property owners to agree not to sell to blacks; these would remain legal until the Court struck them down in 1948.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:8.5\">As a result of housing tensions, many blacks ended up creating their own cities within big cities, fostering the growth of a new urban African-American culture. The most prominent example was Harlem in New York City, a formerly all-white neighborhood that by the 1920s housed some 200,000 African Americans. The black experience during the Great Migration became an important theme in the artistic movement known first as the New Negro Movement and later as the Harlem Renaissance, which would have an enormous impact on the culture of the era.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",
