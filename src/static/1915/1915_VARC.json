They obviously matter to the 400,000 Somali children with acute malnutrition and 3 million people living in crisis or emergency food security conditions. Both institutions are keen to demonstrate that they are now truly progressive and dedicated to the elimination of poverty and tackling inequality. Somalia is a good test of whether the grand plans and the lofty rhetoric actually amount to anything, because this is a country that needs help \u2013 and it needs it now.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Somalia narrowly averted a famine earlier this year thanks to an impressive humanitarian effort. The World Bank was part of the effort, because it managed to persuade its board to provide $50m (\u00a337m) through the crisis response window of the International Development Association (IDA), the division of the bank that provides grants and soft loans to the world\u2019s poorest countries.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But the drought and near-famine have left Somalia\u2019s already weak economy in a parlous state. The World Bank has pledged to make a priority of helping fragile and conflict states, of which Somalia is a classic example. When the bank was rattling the tin for a big increase in donor funding for the IDA, one reason it said it needed $75bn to spend over three years was so it could help countries like Somalia. There is, however, a problem. Somalia is not eligible for IDA funds because it owes the bank and the IMF just over $800m \u2013 part of a $5bn debt mountain owed to multilateral and bilateral creditors. These debts were incurred in the 1980s when most of Somalia\u2019s current population \u2013 70% of which is under 30 \u2013 was not even born. Creditors long ago realised they would never get their money back and 90% of the debt has been written off.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So, the obvious way forward would be for Somalia to get debt relief under the heavily indebted poor country initiative (HIPC) established by the IMF and World Bank in 1996. HIPC was designed to free poor countries from unpayable debts, but there were a few countries in which conflict, civil war or ungovernability meant they never qualified. Somalia was one of them. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The two Washington-based multilateral organisations like Somalia\u2019s president, Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed, who they think is changing Somalia for the better, implementing the right sort of reforms. Somalia will have to wait for another two years before it reaches decision point \u2013 the moment under HIPC when its debt arrears will be cleared. The fund wants Somalia to establish a longer track record of reform before it gives the green light to debt relief.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This is the safety-first approach guaranteed not to cause any problems for the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, and the IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, with their executive boards. It is also a fundamentally daft approach. By fast-tracking Somalia through the debt relief process, the two institutions would provide the country\u2019s government with extra resources that would help it improve the resilience of the economy and so make it more likely that the reform process will continue\u2026\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In Somalia\u2019s case that could be done in one of two ways. The World Bank and the IMF could bring forward Somalia\u2019s decision point and write off its arrears, providing access to multi-year funding under the IDA. Alternatively, the bank could decide that Somalia is moving toward the point at which it will qualify for debt relief and so allocate a pre-arrears clearance grant.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">There is a precedent for the World Bank and the IMF getting a move on, because Liberia was fast-tracked in 2004. That, though, was with the support of the US treasury, which is not minded to be as generous to Somalia.

There is, however, a problem. Somalia is not eligible for IDA funds because it owes the bank and the IMF just over $800m \u2013 part of a $5bn debt mountain owed to multilateral and bilateral creditors. These debts were incurred in the 1980s when most of Somalia\u2019s current population \u2013 70% of which is under 30 \u2013 was not even born. Creditors long ago realised they would never get their money back and 90% of the debt has been written off.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So, the obvious way forward would be for Somalia to get debt relief under the heavily indebted poor country initiative (HIPC) established by the IMF and World Bank in 1996. HIPC was designed to free poor countries from unpayable debts, but there were a few countries in which conflict, civil war or ungovernability meant they never qualified.

Somalia will have to wait for another two years before it reaches decision point \u2013 the moment under HIPC when its debt arrears will be cleared. The fund wants Somalia to establish a longer track record of reform before it gives the green light to debt relief.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This is the safety-first approach guaranteed not to cause any problems for the World Bank president, Jim Yong Kim, and the IMF\u2019s managing director, Christine Lagarde, with their executive boards.

By fast-tracking Somalia through the debt relief process, the two institutions would provide the country\u2019s government with extra resources that would help it improve the resilience of the economy and so make it more likely that the reform process will continue\u2026\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In Somalia\u2019s case that could be done in one of two ways.

A test of their commitment is whether they are prepared to defend the weak against the strong. It means showing leadership by standing up for what is right.

Both institutions are keen to demonstrate that they are now truly progressive and dedicated to the elimination of poverty and tackling inequality.

If none of that persuades you to look beyond that spiralling shell, then maybe the nautilus&rsquo;s capacity for memory will. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1915_5"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu16":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Which of the following points is the author trying to drive home in this passage?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Pulitzer prizes are generally not equitably distributed to represent various sections of American society. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>While the percentage of women Pulitzer prize-winners has gone up, African and American representation has barely increased in a century.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Pulitzer awards are prejudiced in nature preferring Caucasians over women and journalists of colour. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The compiled data of Pulitzer winners of the last century shows strong biases towards certain categories.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"d","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"5936","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>6<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>8<\/i><i>:<\/i> The passage given below is accompanied by a set of three questions.

The clocks on the spaceship would appear to run at a slower rate relative to Earth. A round trip to our galaxy&#39;s center and back--60,000 light-years--could be completed in 40 years of ship time. Back on Earth, the astronaut would be only 40 years older, while 60,000 years would have passed on Earth. (Note that there is no&nbsp;<\/font><\/font><\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">&#39;<\/span><span style=\"font-family: Arial;\">twin paradox,&#39; it is unambiguous that the space traveler has felt the constant acceleration for 40 years and has aged less, while a hypothetical twin left behind on a spaceship circling Earth has not experienced both). Such a trip would pose formidable engineering problems: the more mass you can concentrate at a single point, the more you can bend the flow of time but the amount of energy required is greater than a planetary mass.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">How could one build a time machine to travel through time? Is it possible to manipulate matter and the geometry of space-time in such a way as to create new paths that circle back in time? One simple hypothesis is to take a wormhole (a tunnel connecting spatially separated regions of space-time) and give one mouth of the wormhole a substantial velocity with respect to the other. Passage through the wormhole would then allow travel to the past.... Although the theoretical properties of wormholes have been extensively studied over the past decade, little is known about how to form a macroscopic wormhole, large enough for a human or a spaceship to pass through. Some speculative theories of quantum gravity tell us that space-time has a complicated, foamlike structure of wormholes on the smallest scales--10<sup>-<\/sup><sup>3<\/sup><sup>3<\/sup> centimeter, or a billion billion times smaller than an electron. Some physicists believe it may be possible to enlarge these microscopic wormholes to usable size (using laser to inject immense amount of negative energy), but at present these ideas are hypothetical. Stephen Hawking has formulated a &quot;Chronology Protection Conjecture,&quot; which states that the laws of nature prevent the creation of a time machine using a wormhole. At the moment, this is just a conjecture. However, it is known that the radiation effects created by gravitons or particles of gravity might fry you as you enter the worm hole. .... <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Perhaps the biggest surprise of the work of the decade is that it is not obvious that the laws of physics forbid time travel. Within the Theory of Special Relativity, the fact that particles cannot move faster than light prevents one from returning after a high-speed trip to a time earlier than the time of departure. Once gravity is included, however, spacetime is curved, so there are solutions to the equations of General Relativity in which particles can travel in paths that take them back to earlier times. Other features of the geometries that solve the equations of General Relativity include gravitational lenses, gravitational waves and black holes. But there do not appear to be regions of spacetime that allow time travel, raising the fundamental question of what forbids them. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Time travel poses all sorts of problems, both technical as well as social. The moral, legal and ethical issues are raised by Larry Dwyer, who notes, &#39;Should a time traveller who punches his younger self (or vice versa) be charged with assault? If he marries in the past can he be tried for bigamy even though his other wife will not be born for almost 5,000 years?&#39;&hellip;. A recent surprise is that one can circumvent the &#39;grandfather paradox,&#39; the idea that it is logically inconsistent for particle paths to loop back to earlier times, because, for example, a granddaughter could go back in time to do away with her grandfather. For several simple physical systems, solutions to the equations of physics exist for any starting condition. In these model systems, something always intervenes to prevent inconsistencies analogous to murdering one&#39;s grandfather. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">&quot;Then why do there seem to be no time machines? Two different answers are consistent with our knowledge. The first is simply that the classical theory has a much broader set of solutions than the correct theory of quantum gravity. It is not implausible that causal structure enters in a fundamental way in quantum gravity and that classical spacetimes with time loops are spurious--in other words, that they do not approximate any states of the complete theory.

That is well known. But antibiotics cause damage to non-target species as well, so these, too, tend to evolve immunity. Since most antibiotics are administered by mouth, the many bacteria that live peacefully in the human gut are particularly susceptible to such evolutionary pressures. The medical consequences of this are ill-understood, in part because most gut bacteria are anaerobes (they flourish only in the absence of oxygen) and so are difficult to culture. But Lisa Maier of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory, in Heidelberg, and her colleagues have, nevertheless, grown 40 of the most common strains of them in anaerobic conditions. They have then gone on to expose those cultures to hundreds of antibiotic drugs for a range of ailments, at the sorts of concentrations that might be encountered in the human intestine. __________________________________________________\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The researchers noticed too that the strains of bacteria most resistant to the effects of drugs not aimed at them were also those most resistant to antibiotics.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Some strains they looked at which were resistant to antibiotics nevertheless succumbed to one or more of the non-antibiotic drugs thrown at them.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>This could be a starting point for the development of new antimicrobial agents which would eliminate bacteria that have proved intractable to other means.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Their study has revealed an unexpected avenue by which gut bacteria can become resistant to antibiotics: exposure to drugs that were designed to act on human cells rather than microbial ones.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"d","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"}}
