All you have to do is point and grunt.\u201d For years, psychologist Michael Corballis in his book <i>The <\/i><i>Truth <\/i><i>about <\/i><i>Language <\/i>has been one of the chief proponents of the idea that language has its origins in gestures. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Language is considered the jewel in the crown of human superiority over other animals. It emerges out of nowhere in our evolutionary past, and no other animal\"s communication comes close to it. Through clicks, hoots, barks and bleats, some animals can inform each other of how they are feeling. And some, through gestures, can signal anger, impatience, dominance or submission, desire and attachment.

All you have to do is point and grunt.\u201d For years, psychologist Michael Corballis in his book <i>The <\/i><i>Truth <\/i><i>about <\/i><i>Language <\/i>has been one of the chief proponents of the idea that language has its origins in gestures. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Language is considered the jewel in the crown of human superiority over other animals. It emerges out of nowhere in our evolutionary past, and no other animal\"s communication comes close to it. Through clicks, hoots, barks and bleats, some animals can inform each other of how they are feeling. And some, through gestures, can signal anger, impatience, dominance or submission, desire and attachment. But none can use these displays to convey a sentence like \u201cI kicked the ball\u201d.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Being unique and powerful, human language is a siren to Darwinians, teasing us to examine how it arose, and from what. Corballis assigns a central role to the brain\"s mirror neurons, which seem to echo action in observation (in monkeys, mirror neurons fire when they reach to grasp objects, and when they observe another animal doing the same). There is an overlap between parts of the mirror-neuron system and two areas in the brain\"s left cerebral cortex that are associated in humans with language production \u2212 Broca\"s and Wernicke\"s areas. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Mirror neurons have their detractors but for Corballis they raise the possibility that language \u201cevolved within a system that, back in our monkey days, was specialised for grasping things\u201d. In humans, mirror neurons also seem to be involved with other actions. One is pointing. Conveniently for Corballis, this is one of the earliest milestones of communication in children, emerging around the first year, and signifying the beginning of shared attention. ... And the fine control of facial muscles required for speaking seems to share cortical circuitry with regions that control gestures.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Still, what is wrong with the view that our language grew from our hominid ancestors\" capacity for vocalization? Charles Darwin thought that the capacity for complex vocal learning had deep evolutionary roots, extending at least as far back as our common ancestor with birds. Corballis counters that primate vocalizations, unlike gestures, seem barely under voluntary control. He contends that they emerge like nervous tics, more closely connected to expression of emotion than to a deliberate exchange of information.

Moving replacement parts through a long supply chain to a far-flung ship or base can take weeks and keeping a full range of spares near the front line is unrealistic.
