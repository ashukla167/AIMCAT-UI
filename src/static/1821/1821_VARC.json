Most of us (and most of our societies) are constantly tending to narrow our focus, to ignore embarrassing qualifications and complexities, make all this into merely a backcloth to the stage on which our egos do act comfortably. Literature can help to bring us up short, to stop the moulds from setting firm. It habitually seeks to break the two dimensional frame of fixed \u2018being\u2019 which we just as habitually try to put round others to make us see them again as <b>three <\/b><b>dimensional <\/b><b>people <\/b>in a constant state of \u2018becoming\u2019.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">It is all the time implicitly inviting us to remain responsive and alert and to extend our humanity; we do not talk quite so easily about all farm labourers or even about \u2018all Russians\u2019 after we have read Hardy or Turgenev. It is implicitly inviting us to widen and deepen our knowledge of ourselves and of our relations with others, to realize that life is more this and more that than we had been willing to think.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">All this, we have to remember, may be achieved \u2013 may sometimes only be achieved \u2013 in a mythic and parabolic way. When we speak of the moral intelligence of art\u2019 we are not speaking only of the will in action but also of a world outside the will, of the unconscious psychic-life literature of men \u2013 along with the other arts, which have their own ways of informing the imagination \u2013 that can help us to rediscover awe.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">What is true of individuals is true also of societies. A society without a literature has that much less chance of embodying within its temper and so within its organizations sometimes of the fullness of human experience. We only know certain by articulating them. This does not mean that we have to \u2018argue them out\u2019.

It can make us feel all this, but not necessarily act on this. We can see and do otherwise, always. But we are not then acting quite so much out of blindness and inarticulateness; we are selfishly or fearfully or willfully trying to short circuit what we know underneath to be more nearly the true state of things. Works of literature, properly read, give us the opportunity to extend our imaginative grasp of human experience; if we will to act well thereafter we may be able to do so with greater flexibility and insight. In this special sense literature can be morally educative. It can guide the moral will in so far as its illuminations depreciate certain modes of conduct and, conversely, reinforce others.

But we can only understand that criticism and make our own judgement on it if we first \u2013 in a sense \u2013 suspend the will, if we attend to the literature as itself, as if it were an autonomous object, and let it work in its own way.

Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\">Literature seeks to articulate something of the \"mass and majesty\" of experience. Most of us (and most of our societies) are constantly tending to narrow our focus, to ignore embarrassing qualifications and complexities, make all this into merely a backcloth to the stage on which our egos do act comfortably. Literature can help to bring us up short, to stop the moulds from setting firm. It habitually seeks to break the two dimensional frame of fixed \u2018being\u2019 which we just as habitually try to put round others to make us see them again as <b>three <\/b><b>dimensional <\/b><b>people <\/b>in a constant state of \u2018becoming\u2019.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">It is all the time implicitly inviting us to remain responsive and alert and to extend our humanity; we do not talk quite so easily about all farm labourers or even about \u2018all Russians\u2019 after we have read Hardy or Turgenev. It is implicitly inviting us to widen and deepen our knowledge of ourselves and of our relations with others, to realize that life is more this and more that than we had been willing to think.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">All this, we have to remember, may be achieved \u2013 may sometimes only be achieved \u2013 in a mythic and parabolic way. When we speak of the moral intelligence of art\u2019 we are not speaking only of the will in action but also of a world outside the will, of the unconscious psychic-life literature of men \u2013 along with the other arts, which have their own ways of informing the imagination \u2013 that can help us to rediscover awe.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">What is true of individuals is true also of societies. A society without a literature has that much less chance of embodying within its temper and so within its organizations sometimes of the fullness of human experience. We only know certain by articulating them. This does not mean that we have to \u2018argue them out\u2019. We may know some things only by approaching them metaphorically, as \u2018dramatic play\u2019.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">So literature can make us sense more adequately the fullness, the weight, the inter relations and the demands of human experience and the possibilities of order. It can make us feel all this, but not necessarily act on this. We can see and do otherwise, always. But we are not then acting quite so much out of blindness and inarticulateness; we are selfishly or fearfully or willfully trying to short circuit what we know underneath to be more nearly the true state of things. Works of literature, properly read, give us the opportunity to extend our imaginative grasp of human experience; if we will to act well thereafter we may be able to do so with greater flexibility and insight. In this special sense literature can be morally educative. It can guide the moral will in so far as its illuminations depreciate certain modes of conduct and, conversely, reinforce others.

But it leaves us with the question of the circumstances under which states see others as menaces to their security, a question that psychological theories can help answer. At the start a methodological problem should be noted: in order to determine what leads states to perceive others as threats one needs to examine cases in which this perception is absent as well as cases in which it is present. When one looks at only the latter \u2013 which is common in this area, as in many others in social science \u2013 the factors one locates may be necessary conditions but may not separate the circumstances that lead to the feeling of menace from those that do not.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The most appropriate way for states to judge whether others are a threat would be by monitoring their capabilities. Using worst case analysis, they could assume that others were preparing to do as much harm to them as possible. Indeed, some versions of balance of power theory imply that statesmen should and do draw inferences in this way. But this does not seem to be the case. Although capabilities are rarely ignored, they do not determine the image that is formed. On the one hand, the United States could easily destroy Britain, France, and West Germany, yet those countries do not fear a U.S. attack; Britain and France could inflict grave damage on the United States, but the United States wants to see those countries increase rather than decrease their arms. On the other hand, in the mid and late 1940s the United States came to see the Soviet Union as hostile even while realizing that it was weak.

This is a legitimate approach \u2013 any theory has to start from somewhere. But it leaves us with the question of the circumstances under which states see others as menaces to their security, a question that psychological theories can help answer. At the start a methodological problem should be noted: in order to determine what leads states to perceive others as threats one needs to examine cases in which this perception is absent as well as cases in which it is present. When one looks at only the latter \u2013 which is common in this area, as in many others in social science \u2013 the factors one locates may be necessary conditions but may not separate the circumstances that lead to the feeling of menace from those that do not.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The most appropriate way for states to judge whether others are a threat would be by monitoring their capabilities. Using worst case analysis, they could assume that others were preparing to do as much harm to them as possible. Indeed, some versions of balance of power theory imply that statesmen should and do draw inferences in this way. But this does not seem to be the case. Although capabilities are rarely ignored, they do not determine the image that is formed. On the one hand, the United States could easily destroy Britain, France, and West Germany, yet those countries do not fear a U.S. attack; Britain and France could inflict grave damage on the United States, but the United States wants to see those countries increase rather than decrease their arms. On the other hand, in the mid and late 1940s the United States came to see the Soviet Union as hostile even while realizing that it was weak. Indeed, it was even weaker than Americans thought and, to a significant extent, perceptions of Soviet strength seem to have been more the product than the cause of perceptions of Soviet hostility.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Judging others\u2019 intentions is notoriously difficult. Any number of methods of inference can be used, all of them fallible. Statesmen can concentrate on what they believe is the other\u2019s objective situation if they believe that the external environment is the most important source of its behaviour; they can look to its past behaviour if they think national character or domestic attributes are crucial; they can study the goals, beliefs, and personalities of their opposite numbers if they think idiosyncratic characteristics matter. Of course, all three kinds of variables may and probably do influence foreign policy, but statesmen are no more able than scholars to construct useful hypotheses based on an excessive number of factors.

Psychologists call it the \"Proustian phenomenon,\" after French novelist Marcel Proust. Near the beginning of the masterpiece \"In Search of Lost Time,\" Proust\"s narrator dunks a madeleine cookie into a cup of tea \u2013 and the scent and taste unleash a torrent of childhood memories for 3,000 pages.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Now, this phenomenon is getting the scientific treatment. Neuroscientists have discovered, for instance, how sensory memories are shared across the brain, with different brain regions remembering the sights, smells, tastes and sounds of a particular experience. Meanwhile, psychologists have demonstrated that memories triggered by smells can be more emotional, as well as more detailed, than memories not related to smells.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">When you inhale, odor molecules set brain cells dancing within a region known as the amygdala, a part of the brain that helps control emotion.

Their advantages to society are obvious: they pollute far less than internal combustion engines, and use less energy too. A city of electric cars will be cleaner and quieter than our present stinking streets. And at some stage in the next decade, their advantages to private drivers will become overwhelming. The electric car will become a mainstream status symbol and it is the buyers of internal combustion vehicles who will feel like weird outsiders. The Dutch parliament has considered a measure which would make all cars sold there electric by 2025.

Part of this is their obvious role in transportation. All-electric traffic will be faster, reversing the trend of the last century. Lighter cars will accelerate and brake more quickly, while increasing automation will mean traffic moves more freely. If those trends continue, the private car might disappear altogether, replaced by a network of hired autonomous vehicles, at least within cities.
