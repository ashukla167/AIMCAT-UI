Indeed, it seems fair to say that it wasn\u2019t until Homo sapiens became Homo fabulans, a creature capable of verbally transmitting an account of lived experience to its fellow creatures, that human life as we know it began. Surely by the time the first caves were painted with those astonishingly sophisticated renderings of horses, mammoths and bulls, some equally highly codified and now forever-lost body of cultural knowledge was being passed down through the generations around the crackling fire.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Literature is life\u2019s long-lost twin, its hidden velvet lining, its mournful ghost. The relationship between the two can be expressed only as a metaphor, permanently equivocal and impossible to pin down. But whatever genetic mutation (or angelic blessing, or demonic curse) gave rise to this human drive to recreate our lived experience in language and share that creation with our fellow hairless primates, we\u2019re stuck with it now. Literature may not be in a strict sense useful - may even, by its nature, mock \u201cusefulness\u201d as a category, allying itself first with pleasure, idleness and play - but its necessity seems self-evident from the mere fact of its continued existence, so inextricably bound up with our species\u2019 own.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cPoetry makes nothing happen,\u201d wrote W. H. Auden in a poem on the occasion of William Butler Yeats\u2019s death in 1939. It\u2019s a line that\u2019s often quoted out of context as a critique of the inward-looking hermeticism of literary culture - and, to be sure, Auden was in part mourning the incapacity of even the most politically engaged art to stave off the awful fate looming over Europe at the time. But the rest of the stanza makes clear just how important this \u201cnothing\u201d that poetry enables is to the survival of human culture.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Literature is the record we have of the conversation between those of us now alive on earth and everyone who\u2019s come before and will come after, the cumulative repository of humanity\u2019s knowledge, wonder, curiosity, passion, rage, grief and delight. It\u2019s as useless as a spun-sugar snowflake and as practical as a Swiss Army knife (or, in Kafka\u2019s stunning description of what a book should be, \u201can ice-axe to break the sea frozen inside us\u201d).

Here, suffering is not merely physical discomfort, like having the flu or shutting a door on your hand. Suffering is personal: you\u2019ll toil to avoid feeling flawed in some way. You\u2019ll constantly worry about your reputation or that you\u2019re failing to live up to standards created by others.
