In a third group we find applied economists and applied econometricians, whose published work usually reports results from the analysis of economic data. Finally, in the fourth group reside \u201call the others\u201d \u2013 for example, government policy makers, economic consultants, and bank employees.

To wit: Mathematics is created out of the empty set, and its assertions concern properties of symbols. Mathematicians interpret their symbols to see if their axioms are consistent. The symbols then become sets to some and real numbers to others. Mathematical economists also interpret their symbols \u2013 the undefined terms of their theories \u2013 to check whether their axioms are consistent. The symbols then become, say, money and capital. But \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201ccapital\u201d are symbols just as much as <i>x <\/i>and <i>y <\/i>are symbols, and symbols per se are of no interest in economics. To be adequate, an interpretation of the symbols of an economic theory must describe at least one situation in which the empirical relevance of the theory can be tested.

Haavelmo\u2019s unquestioned authority and the profoundness of his arguments notwithstanding, I believe that the methodological basis that he constructed for applied economics and econometrics is inadequate because it does not provide economic researchers with a formal theoretical apparatus that can guide them in formulating their statistical models and provide them with an easy means of checking whether their arguments are sound.

Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\">Economists can be divided into four almost separate groups. In one group we find the pure theorists, many of whom refer to themselves as mathematical economists. In another group the pure econometricians reside. Most of their work belongs in the realm of mathematical statistics. In a third group we find applied economists and applied econometricians, whose published work usually reports results from the analysis of economic data. Finally, in the fourth group reside \u201call the others\u201d \u2013 for example, government policy makers, economic consultants, and bank employees. Their work is guided by methodological considerations that are of little interest here. Each of the other three groups has a methodological basis for their members\u2019 work that is inadequate for an orderly development of the science of economics. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The pure theorists\u2019 methodological basis is identical with the methodological basis of nonintuitionistic mathematics\u2026 This methodological basis may be adequate for the development of pure mathematics, but it is sorely inadequate for developing economic theory. To wit: Mathematics is created out of the empty set, and its assertions concern properties of symbols. Mathematicians interpret their symbols to see if their axioms are consistent. The symbols then become sets to some and real numbers to others. Mathematical economists also interpret their symbols \u2013 the undefined terms of their theories \u2013 to check whether their axioms are consistent. The symbols then become, say, money and capital. But \u201cmoney\u201d and \u201ccapital\u201d are symbols just as much as <i>x <\/i>and <i>y <\/i>are symbols, and symbols per se are of no interest in economics. To be adequate, an interpretation of the symbols of an economic theory must describe at least one situation in which the empirical relevance of the theory can be tested. The methodological basis of mathematics provides no guidelines for formulating such an interpretation.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The methodological basis of the work of the applied economists and econometricians is described in Trygve Haavelmo\u2019s seminal treatise <i>The <\/i><i>Probability <\/i><i>Approach <\/i><i>in <\/i><i>Econometrics <\/i>(1944). There Haavelmo delineates the relationship between abstract economic theories and economic reality, discusses the nature of stochastic models and their applicability to economic data, and outlines a general scheme for testing economic theories. Haavelmo\u2019s unquestioned authority and the profoundness of his arguments notwithstanding, I believe that the methodological basis that he constructed for applied economics and econometrics is inadequate because it does not provide economic researchers with a formal theoretical apparatus that can guide them in formulating their statistical models and provide them with an easy means of checking whether their arguments are sound.

Since this medium operates mechanically to produce images through the use of light, chemistry, and machinery, it is alleged that photographic depiction can occur without the intervention of artistic intentions, and that the results possess unusual veracity. On this view, photographs are emanations from their subject matter or little bits of reality rather than representations of it. They serve as testimonials; it is pointed out that photographs, but not paintings, are used as evidence. Sonograms are first proof of a new human life and children\u2019s school pictures document their changing appearance over the years. At the other end of the spectrum, photographs of the dead at funerals show us that the deceased person existed until only recently.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But discussions of photographic realism seem to involve an important ambiguity. In one sense, to speak of a photograph\u2019s realism is to assert something about the image\u2019s <i>epistemic <\/i><i>value<\/i>, implying that it has a particular kind of accuracy or that it is a truthful representation. Here the causal origin of the image is relevant, since it links photographs to other kinds of signs that show a direct causal link to their source, such as X-rays or electrocardiograms.  Such signs may even be found in nature, as in the case of measles spots, teeth marks, footprints, or blood spatters at murder scenes. These indicative marks are what C. S. Pierce would call indexical signs; they may not be images at all. They will not present a \u201cpicture\u201d directly to our eyes unless we are experts trained at interpreting them. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In this second sense, the label \u201crealistic\u201d characterizes the <i>psychological <\/i><i>force <\/i>or emotional persuasiveness of certain images. They seem to present something directly to our eyes in a particularly vivid and lifelike way. When I view a photograph of my dead grandmother, it seems as if she is smiling directly at me. But images made in other media can be realistic in this psychological sense without being literally accurate or mechanically caused in the way photographs are. \u2026 \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The ambiguity in the label \u201crealistic\u201d can be understood to reflect a fundamental difference in the way photographs and other images are commonly used. In his book <i>The <\/i><i>Engine <\/i><i>of <\/i><i>Visualization<\/i><i>: <\/i><i>Thinking <\/i><i>through <\/i><i>Photography<\/i>, Patrick Maynard draws a distinction much like what I have in mind between the two senses of realism, but he describes it in terms of how images actually function. Maynard speaks of the difference between an image\u2019s \u201cdepictive\u201d or representational function and its \u201cmanifestation\u201d function.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Maynard traces these two functions of photographs back to sources within two distinct traditions of image-making in Europe. In the West, art associated mainly with Catholicism developed forms of ever more naturalistic, illusionistic depiction. On the other hand, in Eastern Orthodox realms, emphasis was instead placed upon icons as hieratic images revealing some holy person\u2019s manifestation. Such manifestation has less to do with effecting a realistic likeness than with supplying the viewer \/with a sense of contact or presence with the represented subject. Insofar as a photographic image functions today to supply a similar sense of contact or manifestation, Maynard says, it \u201cresembles an earlier and prolific, important sort of image, an icon: \u2018an image whose <i>function <\/i>is largely that of manifesting what it depicts and thereby providing realism through the sense of presence.\u2019\u201d\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

In those chapters of Don Quixote which argue whether the barber\"s basin is a helmet and the donkey\"s packsaddle a steed\"s fancy regalia, the problem is dealt with explicitly; other passages, as I have noted, insinuate this. In the sixth chapter of the first part, the priest and the barber inspect Don Quixote\"s library; astoundingly, one of the books examined is Cervantes\" own <i>Galatea <\/i>and it turns out that the barber is a friend of the author and does not admire him very much, and says that he is more versed in misfortunes than in verses and that the book possesses some inventiveness, proposes a few ideas and concludes nothing. <b>The <\/b><b>barber<\/b><b>, <\/b><b>a <\/b><b>dream <\/b><b>or <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>form <\/b><b>of <\/b><b>a <\/b><b>dream <\/b><b>of <\/b><b>Cervantes<\/b><b>, <\/b><b>passes <\/b><b>judgment <\/b><b>on <\/b><b>Cervantes<\/b><b>. <\/b><b>. <\/b><b>. <\/b><b>.<\/b><b>\n<\/b><\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">This play of strange ambiguities culminates in the second part; the protagonists have read the first part, the protagonists of Don Quixote are, at the same time, readers of Don Quixote. Here it is inevitable to recall the case of Shakespeare, who includes on the stage of Hamlet another stage where a tragedy more or less like that of Hamlet is presented; the imperfect correspondence of the principal and secondary works lessens the efficacy of this inclusion. Something similar is created by accident in <i>The <\/i><i>Thousand <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>One <\/i><i>Nights<\/i>.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><i>The <\/i><i>Thousand <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>One <\/i><i>Nights <\/i>is an overdetermined narrative of magic, adventure, parable and poetry that, duplicates and reduplicates to the point of vertigo the ramifications of a central story in later and subordinate stories, but does not attempt to gradate its realities, and the effect (which should have been profound) is superficial, like a Persian carpet. The opening story of the series is well known: the terrible pledge of the king who every night marries a virgin who is then decapitated at dawn, and the resolution of Scheherazade, who distracts the king with her fables until a thousand and one nights have gone by and she shows him their son. The sheer length of the piece obliged the story\u2019s many copyists over the centuries to make numerous interpolations, one of which marks a perturbing turn in this already vertiginous confection. This involves the story of the six hundred and second night, magical among all the nights. On that night, the king hears from the queen his own story. He hears the beginning of the story, which comprises all the others and also, monstrously itself. So the heroine Scheherazade contrives an elaborate metafiction that potentially unhinges its internal drama. By drawing into her narrative the beginning of the story, what brought her there in the first instance, all the stories told her king hitherto and \u2013 monstrously \u2013 that story she is telling itself, does the reader clearly grasp the vast possibility of this interpolation, the curious danger? That the queen may persist and the motionless king hear forever the truncated story of <i>The <\/i><i>Thousand <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>One <\/i><i>Nights<\/i>, __________________________________________\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The inventions of philosophy are no less fantastic than those of art: Josiah Royce, in the first volume of his work <i>The <\/i><i>World <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>the <\/i><i>Individual <\/i>(1899), has formulated the following: \"Let us imagine that a portion of the soil of England has been leveled off perfectly and that on it a cartographer traces a map of England. The job is perfect; there is no detail of the soil of England, no matter how minute, that is not registered on the map; everything has there its correspondence. This map, in such a case, should contain a map of the map, which should contain a map of the map of the map, and so on to infinity.\"\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Why does it disturb us that the map be included in the map and the thousand and one nights in the book of <i>The <\/i><i>Thousand <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>One <\/i><i>Nights<\/i>? Why does it disturb us that Don Quixote be a reader of the <i>Quixote <\/i>and Hamlet a spectator of <i>Hamlet<\/i>? I believe that these inversions suggest that if the characters of a fictional work can be readers or spectators, we, its readers or spectators, can be fictitious. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">\u201cEvery novel is an ideal plane inserted into the realm of reality; Cervantes, who wrote Don Quixote, takes pleasure in confusing the objective and the subjective, the world of the reader and the world of the book. In those chapters of Don Quixote which argue whether the barber\"s basin is a helmet and the donkey\"s packsaddle a steed\"s fancy regalia, the problem is dealt with explicitly; other passages, as I have noted, insinuate this. In the sixth chapter of the first part, the priest and the barber inspect Don Quixote\"s library; astoundingly, one of the books examined is Cervantes\" own <i>Galatea <\/i>and it turns out that the barber is a friend of the author and does not admire him very much, and says that he is more versed in misfortunes than in verses and that the book possesses some inventiveness, proposes a few ideas and concludes nothing. <b>The <\/b><b>barber<\/b><b>, <\/b><b>a <\/b><b>dream <\/b><b>or <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>form <\/b><b>of <\/b><b>a <\/b><b>dream <\/b><b>of <\/b><b>Cervantes<\/b><b>, <\/b><b>passes <\/b><b>judgment <\/b><b>on <\/b><b>Cervantes<\/b><b>. <\/b><b>. <\/b><b>. <\/b><b>.<\/b><b>\n<\/b><\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">This play of strange ambiguities culminates in the second part; the protagonists have read the first part, the protagonists of Don Quixote are, at the same time, readers of Don Quixote. Here it is inevitable to recall the case of Shakespeare, who includes on the stage of Hamlet another stage where a tragedy more or less like that of Hamlet is presented; the imperfect correspondence of the principal and secondary works lessens the efficacy of this inclusion. Something similar is created by accident in <i>The <\/i><i>Thousand <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>One <\/i><i>Nights<\/i>.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><i>The <\/i><i>Thousand <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>One <\/i><i>Nights <\/i>is an overdetermined narrative of magic, adventure, parable and poetry that, duplicates and reduplicates to the point of vertigo the ramifications of a central story in later and subordinate stories, but does not attempt to gradate its realities, and the effect (which should have been profound) is superficial, like a Persian carpet. The opening story of the series is well known: the terrible pledge of the king who every night marries a virgin who is then decapitated at dawn, and the resolution of Scheherazade, who distracts the king with her fables until a thousand and one nights have gone by and she shows him their son. The sheer length of the piece obliged the story\u2019s many copyists over the centuries to make numerous interpolations, one of which marks a perturbing turn in this already vertiginous confection. This involves the story of the six hundred and second night, magical among all the nights. On that night, the king hears from the queen his own story. He hears the beginning of the story, which comprises all the others and also, monstrously itself. So the heroine Scheherazade contrives an elaborate metafiction that potentially unhinges its internal drama. By drawing into her narrative the beginning of the story, what brought her there in the first instance, all the stories told her king hitherto and \u2013 monstrously \u2013 that story she is telling itself, does the reader clearly grasp the vast possibility of this interpolation, the curious danger? That the queen may persist and the motionless king hear forever the truncated story of <i>The <\/i><i>Thousand <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>One <\/i><i>Nights<\/i>, __________________________________________\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The inventions of philosophy are no less fantastic than those of art: Josiah Royce, in the first volume of his work <i>The <\/i><i>World <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>the <\/i><i>Individual <\/i>(1899), has formulated the following: \"Let us imagine that a portion of the soil of England has been leveled off perfectly and that on it a cartographer traces a map of England. The job is perfect; there is no detail of the soil of England, no matter how minute, that is not registered on the map; everything has there its correspondence. This map, in such a case, should contain a map of the map, which should contain a map of the map of the map, and so on to infinity.\"\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Why does it disturb us that the map be included in the map and the thousand and one nights in the book of <i>The <\/i><i>Thousand <\/i><i>and <\/i><i>One <\/i><i>Nights<\/i>? Why does it disturb us that Don Quixote be a reader of the <i>Quixote <\/i>and Hamlet a spectator of <i>Hamlet<\/i>? I believe that these inversions suggest that if the characters of a fictional work can be readers or spectators, we, its readers or spectators, can be fictitious. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

Then there is the extremely important phenomenon of polyploidy. Genes are aligned along chromosomes. Every kind of organism has its characteristic number and arrangement of chromosomes. Eggs and sperm (or the appropriate cells in ovules and pollen in case of plants) contain only one set of chromosomes, and is haploid. When they fuse in the act of fertilization, the resulting embryo has two sets of chromosomes and is then diploid. Human beings and chimpanzees are diploid.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Sometimes, the chromosome number will double (as they normally do in preparation for cell division) but the cell fails to divide. The diploid cell becomes tetraploid with four sets of chromosomes. The newly formed tetraploid organism can breed successfully with other tetraploids of its own kinds but it cannot breed successfully with either of its parents. So it forms an instant new species. ... The common potatoes grown in Europe are tetraploid derivatives of diploid potatoes that grow wild (and are cultivated) in the Andes. The octoploids form new species \u2013 unable to interbreed with the tetraploid parents that formed them.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Polyploid is the term that describes any organism with more than two sets of chromosomes. Sometimes the complications become too much even for the plants and they finish up with an odd number of chromosomes (some having been lost among all the cell divisions and matings). Plants with anomalous numbers of chromosomes are said to be \u2018aneuploid\u2019. Unlike aneuploid animals who die or tend to be compromised if they live, plants put up with aneuploidy. Sugarcane is aneuploid but that does not stop it being a vigorous major crop.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">There is one further complication. Diploid organisms that are of different species mate to produce fully viable offspring. Usually such crosses fail, because the chromosomes of the two parents are incompatible. ... The cells will not produce sound gametes (eggs and sperm, or ovules and pollen) since this requires close cooperation between chromosomes. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But if a hybrid organism doubles its chromosomes, it often can produce viable gametes. So we find diploid parents of different species mating to produce diploid, hybrid offspring that are sterile; but the hybrids then double their chromosomes and become tetraploid \u2013 and the hybrid tetraploids are then fertile. This happens a lot among plants. Indeed the complications seem endless. A tetraploid plant may mate with a closely related diploid plant to produce a triploid offspring \u2013 two sets of chromosomes from the tetraploid parent and one set from the diploid parent. Triploids are sterile \u2013 they cannot produce gametes at all \u2013 but they may still form viable plants. Thus the cultivated banana is triploid. Because it is sterile, its fruits contain no seeds (as wild banana fruits do). So the domestic banana has to be produced vegetatively, by planting cuttings. Triploid hybrids double their chromosomes to become hexaploid (with six sets of chromosomes). The most famous and important hexaploid organism of all is bread wheat (pasta wheat is diploid). \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Among trees, Willows (genus <i>Salix<\/i>) and Acacias provide hundreds of examples of polyploid species.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\">.... Then there is the extremely important phenomenon of polyploidy. Genes are aligned along chromosomes. Every kind of organism has its characteristic number and arrangement of chromosomes. Eggs and sperm (or the appropriate cells in ovules and pollen in case of plants) contain only one set of chromosomes, and is haploid. When they fuse in the act of fertilization, the resulting embryo has two sets of chromosomes and is then diploid. Human beings and chimpanzees are diploid.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Sometimes, the chromosome number will double (as they normally do in preparation for cell division) but the cell fails to divide. The diploid cell becomes tetraploid with four sets of chromosomes. The newly formed tetraploid organism can breed successfully with other tetraploids of its own kinds but it cannot breed successfully with either of its parents. So it forms an instant new species. ... The common potatoes grown in Europe are tetraploid derivatives of diploid potatoes that grow wild (and are cultivated) in the Andes. The octoploids form new species \u2013 unable to interbreed with the tetraploid parents that formed them.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Polyploid is the term that describes any organism with more than two sets of chromosomes. Sometimes the complications become too much even for the plants and they finish up with an odd number of chromosomes (some having been lost among all the cell divisions and matings). Plants with anomalous numbers of chromosomes are said to be \u2018aneuploid\u2019. Unlike aneuploid animals who die or tend to be compromised if they live, plants put up with aneuploidy. Sugarcane is aneuploid but that does not stop it being a vigorous major crop.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">There is one further complication. Diploid organisms that are of different species mate to produce fully viable offspring. Usually such crosses fail, because the chromosomes of the two parents are incompatible. ... The cells will not produce sound gametes (eggs and sperm, or ovules and pollen) since this requires close cooperation between chromosomes. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But if a hybrid organism doubles its chromosomes, it often can produce viable gametes. So we find diploid parents of different species mating to produce diploid, hybrid offspring that are sterile; but the hybrids then double their chromosomes and become tetraploid \u2013 and the hybrid tetraploids are then fertile. This happens a lot among plants. Indeed the complications seem endless. A tetraploid plant may mate with a closely related diploid plant to produce a triploid offspring \u2013 two sets of chromosomes from the tetraploid parent and one set from the diploid parent. Triploids are sterile \u2013 they cannot produce gametes at all \u2013 but they may still form viable plants. Thus the cultivated banana is triploid. Because it is sterile, its fruits contain no seeds (as wild banana fruits do). So the domestic banana has to be produced vegetatively, by planting cuttings. Triploid hybrids double their chromosomes to become hexaploid (with six sets of chromosomes). The most famous and important hexaploid organism of all is bread wheat (pasta wheat is diploid). \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Among trees, Willows (genus <i>Salix<\/i>) and Acacias provide hundreds of examples of polyploid species.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",
