Urdu is a language of India as well as Pakistan; the boundary is less territorial than religious, with the writing system a visible marker (Urdu&rsquo;s Arabic script connects it to Islam, Hindi&rsquo;s Devanagari links to Sanskrit and Hinduism). <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In other words, the messy facts of the real world complicate the simple narratives some see as necessary for community-building. Nationalists don&rsquo;t like to talk about the awful things their forebears did. They tend to assume that their country&rsquo;s most expansive borders are the natural ones - though these inevitably overlap with their neighbours&rsquo; border claims. Languages are no different. A phrase beloved of some journalists is even truer of nationalists: never let the facts get in the way of a good story. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1904_2"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu20":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>&nbsp;<\/i><i>2<\/i><i>0<\/i><i>:<\/i><i> <\/i>Given below is a paragraph with three blanks.

Within biology, the most celebrated evolutionary process is natural selection: traits that increase fitness are more likely than others to get passed on from one generation to the next. 20<sup>th<\/sup> century evolutionary theory supplements this Darwinian idea with the principle that traits are transmitted genetically. Genes produce traits (or phenotypes), which impact reproductive success, and thereby impact which genes will be copied into the next generation. Richard Dawkins, who helped popularize this idea, characterizes cultural items as &ldquo;memes&rdquo; - a term that echoes &ldquo;gene&rdquo; while emphasizing the idea that culture is passed on mimetically - that is, by imitation.

Moreover, drive states, moods and emotions as well as factors of personality influence duration estimates. For example, time intervals are judged to be longer when we pay more attention to time and when the load of varying experiences stored in memory is higher. _________________(2)____________________ Our subjective well-being also strongly influences how time is experienced. Time speeds up when we are involved in pleasant activities, but it drags during periods of boredom. _________________(3)____________________ Thus, our sense of time is a function of the intricate interplay between specific cognitive functions and of our momentary mood states. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The aforementioned psychological factors definitely influence<i> <\/i>the processing of duration.

They make you vulnerable and dominate you. Part of the magic of going to a movie is surrendering to it, letting it dominate you. The sitting in the dark, the looking up, the tranced distance from the screen, the being able to see the people on the screen without being seen by the people on the screen, the people on the screen being so much bigger than you, prettier than you, more compelling than you, etc. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Film&rsquo;s overwhelming power isn&rsquo;t news. But, different kinds of movies use this power in different ways. Art film is essentially teleological: it tries in various ways to &ldquo;wake the audience up&rdquo; or render us more &ldquo;conscious&rdquo;.

They make you vulnerable and dominate you. Part of the magic of going to a movie is surrendering to it, letting it dominate you. The sitting in the dark, the looking up, the tranced distance from the screen, the being able to see the people on the screen without being seen by the people on the screen, the people on the screen being so much bigger than you, prettier than you, more compelling than you, etc. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Film&rsquo;s overwhelming power isn&rsquo;t news. But, different kinds of movies use this power in different ways. Art film is essentially teleological: it tries in various ways to &ldquo;wake the audience up&rdquo; or render us more &ldquo;conscious&rdquo;. This kind of agenda can easily degenerate into pretentiousness and self-righteousness and condescending twaddle, but the agenda itself is large-hearted and fine. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Commercial film doesn&rsquo;t seem like it cares very much about an audience&rsquo;s instruction or enlightenment. Commercial film&rsquo;s goal is to &ldquo;entertain,&rdquo; which usually means enabling various fantasies that allow the movie-goer to pretend he&rsquo;s somebody else and that life is somehow bigger and more coherent and more compelling and attractive and in general just more entertaining than a moviegoer&rsquo;s life really is. You could say that a commercial movie doesn&rsquo;t try to wake people up but rather to make their sleep so comfortable and their dreams so pleasant that they will fork over money to experience it - this seduction, a fantasy-for-money transaction, is a commercial movie&rsquo;s basic point. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">An art film&rsquo;s point is usually more intellectual or aesthetic, and you usually have to do some interpretive work to get it, so that when you pay to see an art film you&rsquo;re actually paying to do work, whereas the only work you have to do with most commercial films is whatever work you did to afford the price of the ticket. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">David Lynch&rsquo;s movies are often described as occupying a kind of middle ground between art and commercial film. But, what they really occupy is a whole third different kind of territory. Most of Lynch&rsquo;s best films don&rsquo;t really have much of a point, and in lots of ways they seem to resist the film-interpretive process by which avant-garde movies are understood. The British critic Paul Taylor says that Lynch&rsquo;s movies are indeed &lsquo;to be experienced rather than explained.&rsquo; Lynch&rsquo;s movies are susceptible to a variety of sophisticated interpretations, but it would be a serious mistake to conclude from this that his movies&rsquo; point is &ldquo;film-interpretation is necessarily multivalent&rdquo; or something - they&rsquo;re just not that kind of movie. Nor are they seductive in the commercial sense. You never get the sense that the point is to entertain you, and never that the point is to get you to fork over money to see it. The unsettling thing is that you don&rsquo;t feel like you are entering into any of the standard unspoken contracts you normally enter into with other kinds of movies.
