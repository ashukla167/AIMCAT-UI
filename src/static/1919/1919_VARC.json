But human evolution could suggest otherwise. In a new study, researchers found that as early humans migrated into colder northern climates, a genetic mutation that knocks about a centimeter off height and increases the risk of osteoarthritis by up to 80 percent may have helped some of them survive the most recent ice age. While some traits resulting from this mutation may seem unfavorable today, they were advantageous to early humans venturing out of Africa about 60,000 years ago. \u201cThere are many cases like this where evolution is a trade-off,\u201d said David Kingsley, an author of the study, which appeared in Nature Genetics on Monday, and a professor of developmental biology at Stanford University.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The shorter stature may have helped these prehistoric humans retain heat and stave off frostbite in their extremities, the authors said. It also may have reduced their risk of life-threatening bone fractures when slipping on icy surfaces. But the same gene puts humans at greater risk for arthritis in the modern era as they live well beyond their reproductive years. The study looked at variants of the GDF5 gene, which was first linked to skeletal growth in the early 1990s, and is known to be involved in bone growth and joint formation. The researchers wanted to understand how the DNA sequences around it might affect the gene\u2019s expression, focusing on one region they named GROW1.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">After analyzing the sequence of GROW1 in the 1000 Genomes Project database, a collection of sequences from human populations around the globe, the researchers identified a change in one nucleotide, the basic building block of DNA. The change is prevalent in Europeans and Asians but rare in Africans. To see if that mutation was incidental or actually caused shorter stature, they tested the nucleotide change in mice and found it decreased the length of their long bones, much as it is thought to do in humans. That mutation of the regulatory region analyzed in the study is present in more than 50 percent of the population in Europe and Asia. In some Asian populations, it\u2019s up to 90 percent, Dr. Kingsley said. Even if the variant plays only a small role in increasing arthritis risk, the sheer number of people who possess it means it can have a significant effect. \u201cThe very abundance of the change means it could contribute to a lot of cases of arthritis,\u201d Dr. Kingsley said.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">A similar evolutionary paradox can be seen with sickle cell anemia, a condition in which a low number of red blood cells makes it difficult to carry adequate oxygen throughout the body, Dr. Kingsley said. A genetic variant causes a high rate of the disease in African populations. But that variant was favored because it also confers protection against malaria. \u201cThe genome is complex and our evolutionary history is complex,\u201d said Terence D. Capellini, one of the lead authors on the study and an associate professor in the department of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University. \u201cBecause of that complexity, relationships emerge between different aspects of our biology that may seem paradoxical.

While shorter stature may have been a protection against the cold and icy terrain, it\u2019s hard to be certain, said George Perry, associate professor of anthropology and biology at Pennsylvania State University, who is not affiliated with the study. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to know that without some combination of a time machine and an experiment we can\u2019t do,\u201d he said.

Even if the variant plays only a small role in increasing arthritis risk, the sheer number of people who possess it means it can have a significant effect. \u201cThe very abundance of the change means it could contribute to a lot of cases of arthritis,\u201d Dr. Kingsley said.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">A similar evolutionary paradox can be seen with sickle cell anemia, a condition in which a low number of red blood cells makes it difficult to carry adequate oxygen throughout the body, Dr. Kingsley said. A genetic variant causes a high rate of the disease in African populations. But that variant was favored because it also confers protection against malaria. \u201cThe genome is complex and our evolutionary history is complex,\u201d said Terence D. Capellini, one of the lead authors on the study and an associate professor in the department of human evolutionary biology at Harvard University. \u201cBecause of that complexity, relationships emerge between different aspects of our biology that may seem paradoxical. As we reveal this history of our genome and how it affects our biology, we begin to understand the connections.\u201d \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">As with many aspects of evolutionary research, it\u2019s easier to figure out what traits were favored than it is to explain why. While shorter stature may have been a protection against the cold and icy terrain, it\u2019s hard to be certain, said George Perry, associate professor of anthropology and biology at Pennsylvania State University, who is not affiliated with the study. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to know that without some combination of a time machine and an experiment we can\u2019t do,\u201d he said. But detailed studies like this can help further our understanding of complex evolutionary processes and the potential consequences for modern medicine and human health, Dr. Perry said.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1919"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu13":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">According to the passage, how are American students born into the middle class different from those born into poverty when it comes to their earnings? <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In America, .... <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>college graduates born poor earn slightly more than those born middle class.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>male college graduates raised in poverty earn nearly the same as male high school graduates born middle class.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT3":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">male college graduates raised in middle class earn less than non-degree holders born into poverty. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT4":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\tall high school diploma holders born into poverty earn slightly more than those born middle class.<\/p>","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"5751","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>3<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>8<\/i><i>:<\/i> The passage given below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

For him, the &quot;war of the world&quot; begins with the Japanese defeat of the Russian navy in 1905 and doesn&#39;t end until the conclusion of the Korean War in 1953. Seen this way, World War I and II become peaks in a series of eruptions around the globe, all fueled by the incendiary confluence of three developments. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The first factor was economic. The 20th century was marked by rapid changes in prices and growth rates, and such volatility triggered social and political instability. The second development was social. Ethnic tensions, already growing, were heightened by the century&#39;s economic ups and downs. And the third factor was the decline of traditional empires. Anti-liberal empires such as Russia, Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire, with many ethnic groups on their borders, have disintegrated and devolved into relatively stable and racially homogenized nation-states such as Poland, Italy, Japan and Germany. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">These aggressive new powers also embraced race theories that trumpeted the natural superiority of some ethnic groups. Earlier imperial powers had accepted interbreeding and the resulting racial melting pots as a natural characteristic of empire, but the supposedly scientific racism demanded an end to such mixing. Brutal conquest, ethnic cleansing and even genocide were more easily inflicted on so-called subhumans. Such racist thinking was prevalent in the first three decades of the 20th century, and as a result attacks against minorities occurred throughout the unstable, racially mixed communities of Eastern and Central Europe. .... <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In Germany, assimilation&#39;s protective covering was torn away by the Nazi belief that the mixing of blood degraded the master race. &quot;Hitler&#39;s determination to exclude Jews from the <i>V<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>l<\/i><i>k<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>g<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>m<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>h<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>f<\/i><i>t<\/i> [the Nazi term for a racially pure community] meant identifying and persecuting a tiny minority that was inextricably interwoven into the fabric of German society,&quot; Ferguson writes. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">To Ferguson, the outbreak of war was an &quot;avoidable political error,&quot; and its massive destruction represented &quot;nothing more than the most terrific train crash.&quot; But he concludes that a military confrontation with the Axis powers was unavoidable, given their determination to expand their living space, control vital strategic resources and found a new world order. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The Axis powers&#39; aggressive intentions in the 1930s should have convinced the Western allies to nip Hitler&#39;s aggrandizing moves in the bud, thus avoiding the all-out conflagration of World War II.

But Concorde, although a technological marvel for its time, was never a commercial success: the 14 aircraft that saw service were heavily subsidised by British and French taxpayers; they had limited range and they guzzled fuel flying subsonically, which they were largely forced to do over land because of their sonic booms. Yet the idea of a Concorde successor has never quite gone away. ________________________________________________\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Reducing the sound of a sonic boom is impossible without computational fluid dynamics, which relies on powerful computer systems.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>If a supersonic airliner were to fly again, however, such a noisy footprint would have to be toned down.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>If the aircraft's quieter boom does prove to be acceptable, then its sound \u201csignature\u201d could become a certification standard that any future supersonic passenger aircraft would have to meet.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>\u201cWe are not shooting completely in the dark,\u201d says Peter Cohen, head of commercial supersonic technology at NASA's Langley Research Centre in Hampton, Virginia.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu34":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i>3<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i>4<\/i><i>:<\/i><i> <\/i>Each of the following questions has a paragraph from which the last sentence has been left incomplete.

His railroad still stood; his battle to build it had dissolved into a legend, because people preferred not to understand it or believe it possible. He was a man who had never accepted the creed that others had the right to stop him. He set his goal and moved toward it, his way as straight as one of his rails. He never sought any loans, bonds, subsidies, land grants or legislative favours from the government. He obtained money from the men who owned it, going from door to door \u2013 from the mahogany doors of bankers to the clapboard doors of lonely farmhouses. He never talked about the public good. He merely told people that they would make big profits on his railroad, he told them why he expected the profits and he gave his reasons. ________________________________________\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>It was said that Nat Taggart had staked his life on his railroad many times; but once, he staked more than his life.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Yet no penny of his wealth had been obtained by force or fraud.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Through all the generations that followed, Taggart Transcontinental was one of the few railroads that never went bankrupt and the only one whose controlling stock remained in the hands of the founder's descendants.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>In his lifetime, the name \u201cNat Taggart\u201d was not famous but notorious.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"c","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":" ","ESSAY_NAME":"ESSAY_NAME"},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"}}
