They then analysed the DNA to look at what evolutionary biologists call the molecular clock, the rate at which an animal\"s genetic code evolves i.e. They studied the rate at which the base pairs that define the differences between species were incorrectly paired due to errors in the genetic encoding process, an occurrence known as substitution. The speed of the clock shows how the span of a generation has changed over the millennia.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The tests showed that even though humans and chimps split from a common ancestor between 5m and 7m years ago, the rate of human and chimp molecular evolution was extremely similar, differing by only 3%, and much slower than gorillas and orang-utans, with the evolution of humans being the slowest of all.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">As species branch off along evolutionary lines, important genetic traits, like the rate of molecular evolution also begin to diverge. They found that the speed of this molecular clock in humans and chimps is so similar, it suggests that certain human-specific traits, like generation time, began to evolve one million years ago - very recently in terms of evolution. The amount of time between parents and offspring is longer in humans than apes. Since a long generation time is closely correlated with the evolution of a big brain, it also suggests that developmental changes specific to humans may also have evolved very recently. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Most biologists believe that humans and chimpanzees had a common ancestor before the evolutionary lines diverged about 5-7 million years ago. According to the analysis, one million years ago the molecular clock in the line that became modern humans began to slow down. Today, the human molecular clock is only 3 percent slower than the molecular clock of the chimp, while it has slowed down 11 percent from the gorilla\"s molecular clock. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This slow down in the molecular clock correlates with a longer generation time because substitutions need to be passed to the next generation in order to have any lasting effect on the species.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\"A long generation time is an important trait that separates humans from their evolutionary relatives,\" said Navin Elango, graduate student in the School of Biology at Georgia Institute of Technology. \"We used to think that apes shared one generation time, but that\"s not true.

One method looked at adopted children, whose genes were provided by one set of parents and whose environment was provided by a different set. Another method involved finding identical twins separated at birth: same genes, different environments. A third involved comparisons between identical twins and fraternal twins reared in the same family (identical twins have the same genes; fraternal twins are genetically as different as ordinary siblings). Other methods made use of genetic differences between ordinary siblings, half-siblings, and step (adoptive) siblings raised in the same family. These methods produced the same results. About half the variation in the measured characteristic could be attributed to genetic differences. The other half, then, should be the result of environmental effects. But researchers haven\"t been able to pin down which aspects of the environment are important. They are only able to determine which aspects of the environment are not important. ...

The socialisation system makes us want to fit in - to conform to our peers. The status system makes us want to stand out - to be better than our peers. We can see these motivations in people of all ages. The socialisation system and the status system are organs of the mind and are found in all neurologically normal human beings. They vary somewhat from one individual to another. For some, the socialisation system takes priority; for others, the status system often gains the upper hand. These differences become visible only when the two goals - fitting in or standing out - conflict.
