As one of the six founding members of what became the European Union, the Netherlands claims a special place in the European family - through Benelux (cooperation between Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg), the Dutch helped inspire Europe\u2019s integration project.  \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Strategically, the Netherlands has worked to maintain a balance in the EU: among large countries and among institutions. It promoted British membership of the European Community in the 1970s to balance against Franco-German dominance. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">On foreign policy, the Netherlands favors strong international engagement but rarely takes a controversial position. The country wants a strong EU in international affairs to amplify its own bilateral foreign policy and to keep member states in check. But it wants the European External Action Service to coordinate European foreign policies, not direct them. The Hague has been ambitious on European defense cooperation, particularly by integrating its military forces and capabilities with those of Germany and Belgium; but like most other EU members, the Netherlands has dramatically cut its defense budget in previous years. ...\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Since the early 2000s, the Netherlands\u2019 image as a mainstream partner has changed: the Dutch have started to view the EU suspiciously. EU enlargement in 2004 altered the union\u2019s internal balance and member states\u2019 voting weights. The Netherlands has less of a say than some of the newest members, yet it is one of the largest per-capita contributors to the EU budget. Despite the benefits in mutual trade, a larger union meant the Dutch voice became softer. This proved particularly uncomfortable when member states agreed to hand over more powers to Brussels.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The eurozone crisis added further concerns about the EU\u2019s direction of travel: the Netherlands became a creditor country that was asked to bail out Southern eurozone members while having to take their word for it that they would make the reforms necessary to weather the financial storm. The perception that the Dutch were left paying the bill while other countries flouted the rules became fertile ground for Euroskeptic politicians. It boosted the anti-immigrant, anti-EU popularity of Geert Wilders. His Freedom party has taken advantage of rising Dutch anger over the Euro crisis by shifting its focus from a ban on Islam to an exit from the EU. The government saw the commission less as the defender of small countries\u2019 interests and more as an overly ambitious regulator with an appetite to expand its reach.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Dutch Euroskepticism is reaching unheard-of heights: A Gallup survey in early June found voters split evenly, 39 per cent each, on whether to exit the EU entirely. Most recent political polls put the Freedom Party in a close fight for the second-largest share of the vote, and one poll has it in the lead.

If we wanted a label to describe this tide, we might call it \u201cscientism,\u201d the view that every intelligible question has either a scientific solution or no solution at all.

These include questions about love, art, history, culture, music-all questions, in fact, that relate to the attempt to understand ourselves better. There is a widespread feeling today that the great scandal of our times is that we lack a scientific theory of consciousness. And so there is a great interdisciplinary effort, involving physicists, computer scientists, cognitive psychologists and philosophers, to come up with tenable scientific answers to the questions: what is consciousness? What is the self? One of the leading competitors in this crowded field is the theory advanced by the mathematician Roger Penrose, that a stream of consciousness is an orchestrated sequence of quantum physical events taking place in the brain. Penrose\u2019s theory is that a moment of consciousness is produced by a sub-protein in the brain called a tubulin. The theory is, on Penrose\u2019s own admission, speculative, and it strikes many as being bizarrely implausible. But suppose we discovered that Penrose\u2019s theory was correct, would we, as a result, understand ourselves any better? Is a scientific theory the only kind of understanding?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Well, you might ask, what other kind is there? Wittgenstein\u2019s answer to that, I think, is his greatest, and most neglected, achievement. Although Wittgenstein\u2019s thought underwent changes between his early and his later work, his opposition to scientism was constant. Philosophy, he writes, \u201cis not a theory but an activity.\u201d It strives, not after scientific truth, but after conceptual clarity. In the Tractatus, this clarity is achieved through a correct understanding of the logical form of language, which, once achieved, was destined to remain inexpressible, leading Wittgenstein to compare his own philosophical propositions with a ladder, which is thrown away once it has been used to climb up on.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In his later work, Wittgenstein abandoned the idea of logical form and with it the notion of ineffable truths. The difference between science and philosophy, he now believed, is between two distinct forms of understanding: the theoretical and the non-theoretical. Scientific understanding is given through the construction and testing of hypotheses and theories; philosophical understanding, on the other hand, is resolutely non-theoretical. What we are after in philosophy is \u201cthe understanding that consists in seeing connections.\u201d<b>\n<\/b><\/font><b>\n<\/b><\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1923"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu20":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'><b><\/b>According to the passage, Ludwig Wittgenstein developed his theory against which notion?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The notion that deep, impenetrable mysteries of life can be explained by science. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The notion that the answer to any question from any discipline must have a scientific basis.  \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The notion that every question has two answers - a scientific solution and a philosophical solution.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The notion that many questions can be understood using philosophy and not just science.  \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"5048","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>9<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>4<\/i><i>:<\/i><b> <\/b>The passage given below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

His work is opposed, as Wittgenstein himself realized, to \u201cthe spirit which informs the vast stream of European and American civilisation in which all of us stand.\u201d Nearly 50 years after his death, we can see, more clearly than ever, that the feeling that he was swimming against the tide was justified. If we wanted a label to describe this tide, we might call it \u201cscientism,\u201d the view that every intelligible question has either a scientific solution or no solution at all. It is against this view that Wittgenstein set his face.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Scientism takes many forms. In the humanities, it takes the form of pretending that philosophy, literature, history, music and art can be studied as if they were sciences, with \u201cresearchers\u201d compelled to spell out their \u201cmethodologies\u201d - a pretence which has led to huge quantities of bad academic writing, characterised by bogus theorising, spurious specialisation and the development of pseudo-technical vocabularies. Wittgenstein would have looked upon these developments and wept.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">There are many questions to which we do not have scientific answers, not because they are deep, impenetrable mysteries, but simply because they are not scientific questions. These include questions about love, art, history, culture, music-all questions, in fact, that relate to the attempt to understand ourselves better. There is a widespread feeling today that the great scandal of our times is that we lack a scientific theory of consciousness. And so there is a great interdisciplinary effort, involving physicists, computer scientists, cognitive psychologists and philosophers, to come up with tenable scientific answers to the questions: what is consciousness? What is the self? One of the leading competitors in this crowded field is the theory advanced by the mathematician Roger Penrose, that a stream of consciousness is an orchestrated sequence of quantum physical events taking place in the brain. Penrose\u2019s theory is that a moment of consciousness is produced by a sub-protein in the brain called a tubulin. The theory is, on Penrose\u2019s own admission, speculative, and it strikes many as being bizarrely implausible. But suppose we discovered that Penrose\u2019s theory was correct, would we, as a result, understand ourselves any better? Is a scientific theory the only kind of understanding?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Well, you might ask, what other kind is there? Wittgenstein\u2019s answer to that, I think, is his greatest, and most neglected, achievement. Although Wittgenstein\u2019s thought underwent changes between his early and his later work, his opposition to scientism was constant. Philosophy, he writes, \u201cis not a theory but an activity.\u201d It strives, not after scientific truth, but after conceptual clarity. In the Tractatus, this clarity is achieved through a correct understanding of the logical form of language, which, once achieved, was destined to remain inexpressible, leading Wittgenstein to compare his own philosophical propositions with a ladder, which is thrown away once it has been used to climb up on.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In his later work, Wittgenstein abandoned the idea of logical form and with it the notion of ineffable truths.
