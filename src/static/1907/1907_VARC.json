All those key things are lined up by them. With Marvel, it\u2019s clear that Spider-Man is not the same kind of hero as Superman; Cap has similarities, but he has differences as well, and has been used in very interesting ways that stop him from being a clone of any DC counterpart. The Marvel characters are all over the place in terms of what makes them unique, and there\u2019s a hip energy that\u2019s been instilled in them since their creation. Every other superhero company follows the mould of having their heroes follow those archetypes that DC embodies, but Marvel broke away.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Marvel has indeed been known for its kitschy and (in artist terms) \"kinetic\" style, whereas DC is known for its more mythic and almost religious reverence of the superhero archetype. That same stylistic divergence has clearly influenced the cinematic side of things, as DC is defined by more \"high art\" visions like The Dark Knight Trilogy or the Zack Snyder Trilogy, while Marvel Studios has built itself around quirky and kitschy adventures like Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor. Clearly, one formula has been more lucrative at the box-office than the other when it comes to delivering fun movie experiences to audiences, leaving DC with a major roadblock that only Wonder Woman has been able to scale.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1907"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu10":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Which of the following is the most apt example of social modelling?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>A dinner you enjoyed with your friends, where you left feeling as if you had eaten more than you could manage.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>A dinner in which you ordered a pudding because everybody else did.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>A dinner at a conference where you did not eat well because of social norms.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>A dinner with your family in which you ate less so that others could eat more.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"25552","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>0<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>5<\/i><i>:<\/i><b> <\/b>The passage given below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

Gemeinschaft is a social association in which the individuals are inclined towards social community rather than their individual wants and needs. Gesellschaft is a civil society in which the individual needs are given more importance than the social association.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">\u201cGemeinschaft\u201d is a German word which is translated as \u201ccommunity\u201d and mainly emphasizes common mores wherein the individuals believe in appropriate behaviour and responsibility of each other to the association instead of focusing on individual interests and needs. Ferdinand Tonnies believed that family was the perfect epitome of gemeinschaft. On the other hand, gesellschaft translated as \u201csociety\u201d mainly focuses on individual interests rather than large association. Modern businesses, managers, workers, and owners are a good example of a gesellschaft association.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Gemeinschaft emphasizes community ties in which personal relationships and families are given more importance. In contrast, gesellschaft emphasizes more on secondary relationships instead of families and personal relationships. While Gesellschaft is characterized by a more elaborate division of labour, Gemeinschaft typically derives from a moderate division of labour.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Gemeinschaft is identified by small, localized societies as opposed to gesellschaft which is characterized by complex, impersonal societies. The communities in the gemeinschaft theory have strong social bonds, shared values, and benefits. In gesellschaft communities, social ties are impersonal, instrumental, and narrow. Talcott Parsons, a renowned American sociologist, further described gemeinschaft as a collective orientation and gesellschaft as self-orientation.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The gemeinschaft association occurs in small cities where the individuals focus more on the social community interests than their own self interests.
