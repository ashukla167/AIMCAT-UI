Now the picture is different and such studies are &#39;currently fashionable&#39;. Much of this can be credited to Ward Perkins, whose detailed studies of individual sites and objects took place alongside, and in combination with broader discussions of the entire trade in decorative stone, its structure and organization, as well as its historical context. The editors of his collected papers rightly credit Ward Perkins as the main founder of what is now a large field of research, and his work remains the established point of references for any discussion on Roman stone use. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The editors, though were equally correct to assert in 1992 that despite the great intrinsic interest of the subject for archaeologists, art historians and historians alike, there is so far no general and fully accessible book on the ancients&#39; use of marble. This remains true today. Since Ward Perkins was writing, the available datasets have increased markedly on almost all fronts. Considerable numbers of new quarrying sites have been discovered and significant progress has been made in the field of archaeometry. A wider interest in where materials came from and how they were carved can also be seen in more specifically art historical or architectural studies. Discussions of quarrying, carving and the labour involved, are now thoroughly integrated into most work on Roman architecture. Rockwell&#39;s discussions of practicalities of stone carving have also helped to reinvigorate the study of artistic production and foreground it in even the most mainstream studies of Roman and Greek art. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The study of Roman use, in sum, is booming. Despite this, research in this field remains irregularly spread and often highly targeted. There is a lot of material that needs to be drawn together. While archaeometric studies are increasingly revealing where materials came from and how and when they were used, much less work has been done on interpreting what this tells us about how the stone trade was organized and what it reveals about the economy. This is not to say that important synthesis tackling these issues do not exist. Fant worked extensively on the evidence for imperial stone use, while Braemer brought together a lot of data for the more localized patterns of stone use that have tended to be ignored. Pensabene, most notably of all, has produced a huge number of detailed examinations of the production and supply of stone, primarily for architectural projects. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">However, there remain questions to be asked. How did imperial and non-imperial stone use compare with respect to the procurement, distribution and scale? Did the imperial stone trade really lie outside of the normal orbit of trade in marbles and decorative stones, as has been proposed? What can the distribution of stone reveal about wider connectivity, transport logistics, and demand for specific materials? What do stone objects add to our understanding of Roman manufacturing? The basic interpretative framework originally laid out by Ward Perkins, his influential model of the Roman marble trade, has rarely been challenged systematically. This model proposes that as the demand for decorative stone swelled, in the first and second centuries AD, stone production was reorganized along quasi-industrial lines: production became centred on the quarries, with objects being carved in standardized forms and dimensions to stock. This was a less responsive but more efficient system that can be used to explain the apparently repetitive aspect of so much Roman art and architecture. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1803_2"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu16":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Which of the following is definitely true, according to the passage?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Ward Perkins provides the locations of a number of new quarrying sites in his article.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The imperial stone trade was outside the normal orbit of trade in marbles and decorative stones.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Ward Perkins's model could provide a possible reason for the repetitive aspect of Roman architecture.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Studies on the distribution of stone have revealed substantial information regarding wider connectivity, transport logistics and demand for specific materials.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"c","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"4467","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>5<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>0<\/i><i>:<\/i><b> <\/b>The long passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.

Now the picture is different and such studies are &#39;currently fashionable&#39;. Much of this can be credited to Ward Perkins, whose detailed studies of individual sites and objects took place alongside, and in combination with broader discussions of the entire trade in decorative stone, its structure and organization, as well as its historical context. The editors of his collected papers rightly credit Ward Perkins as the main founder of what is now a large field of research, and his work remains the established point of references for any discussion on Roman stone use. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The editors, though were equally correct to assert in 1992 that despite the great intrinsic interest of the subject for archaeologists, art historians and historians alike, there is so far no general and fully accessible book on the ancients&#39; use of marble. This remains true today. Since Ward Perkins was writing, the available datasets have increased markedly on almost all fronts. Considerable numbers of new quarrying sites have been discovered and significant progress has been made in the field of archaeometry. A wider interest in where materials came from and how they were carved can also be seen in more specifically art historical or architectural studies. Discussions of quarrying, carving and the labour involved, are now thoroughly integrated into most work on Roman architecture. Rockwell&#39;s discussions of practicalities of stone carving have also helped to reinvigorate the study of artistic production and foreground it in even the most mainstream studies of Roman and Greek art. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The study of Roman use, in sum, is booming. Despite this, research in this field remains irregularly spread and often highly targeted. There is a lot of material that needs to be drawn together. While archaeometric studies are increasingly revealing where materials came from and how and when they were used, much less work has been done on interpreting what this tells us about how the stone trade was organized and what it reveals about the economy. This is not to say that important synthesis tackling these issues do not exist. Fant worked extensively on the evidence for imperial stone use, while Braemer brought together a lot of data for the more localized patterns of stone use that have tended to be ignored. Pensabene, most notably of all, has produced a huge number of detailed examinations of the production and supply of stone, primarily for architectural projects. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">However, there remain questions to be asked. How did imperial and non-imperial stone use compare with respect to the procurement, distribution and scale? Did the imperial stone trade really lie outside of the normal orbit of trade in marbles and decorative stones, as has been proposed? What can the distribution of stone reveal about wider connectivity, transport logistics, and demand for specific materials? What do stone objects add to our understanding of Roman manufacturing? The basic interpretative framework originally laid out by Ward Perkins, his influential model of the Roman marble trade, has rarely been challenged systematically. This model proposes that as the demand for decorative stone swelled, in the first and second centuries AD, stone production was reorganized along quasi-industrial lines: production became centred on the quarries, with objects being carved in standardized forms and dimensions to stock. This was a less responsive but more efficient system that can be used to explain the apparently repetitive aspect of so much Roman art and architecture. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1803_2"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu21":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><i><b> <\/b><\/i><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>1<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>4<\/i><i>:<\/i><i> <\/i>Given below is a paragraph with two blanks, numbered (i) and (ii).

But although the market can trade in the products of culture, it cannot express the value of culture as a process, or what it does. A cultural economics that captures the value of the arts has to understand value in use, and that involves broader ways of understanding ourselves and our world, for instance, anthropology and environmentalism. The value in use of the arts is that they help a society make sense of itself. They generate the symbols and rituals that create a common identity \u2013 that is why art and religion are so closely linked. Like religion, the arts give access to the spiritual. Art is a link to previous generations, and anchors us to history.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<ol><li style='vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;'><span><p style='vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The value of the arts \u201cin use\u201d precedes their value \u201cin exchange\u201d.

Even a walk through the grocery store becomes an opportunity to teach lessons about choosing, particularly in the United States, where stores routinely offer hundreds of options. A parent will probably narrow down the number of choices and explain the differences between this cereal and that one, or that toy and this one, but the child would be encouraged to express a preference.

There are extreme examples of both in the available literature, and it is difficult to achieve and maintain a proper balance between the two.

Far from considering science a panacea, we are now conscious of the limitations and the negative or destructive results of science.

We have realized that science is not the supremely important tool we once thought it to be for improving the world. On a variety of fronts, from the philosophical to the ruggedly practical, science has been under attack for the sort of world it has produced.

If it is people -- which particular people? Where are they? Why do they need help? Concern with people raises countless questions. Goods do not raise many questions. Particularly when econometricians deal with them, goods cease to be anything identifiable, and become GNP, imports, exports, savings, investment, infrastructure. Impressive models can be built out of these abstractions, but they do not leave room for actual people. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It is much easier to deal with goods than with people. Those who need help are poor, uneducated, and village-based. The helpers are rich, educated and town-based. Three tremendous gulfs separate them: the gulf between rich and poor; the gulf between educated and uneducated; and the gulf between city-men and country-folk. The first problem of development aid is how to bridge these gulfs. The methods of production, the patterns of consumption, the systems of ideas that suit relatively affluent, educated city people are unlikely to suit poor, semi-illiterate peasants. If the people cannot adapt themselves to the methods, then the methods must be adapted to the people. This is the whole crux of the matter. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">There are many questionable features of the rich man&#39;s economy: successful adaptation of poor communities to these features would spell ruin. The life, work, and happiness of all societies depend on certain precious and vulnerable &#39;psychological structures&#39;. Social cohesion, cooperation, mutual respect, courage in the face of adversity, and the ability to bear hardship disintegrate when these &#39;psychological structures&#39; are gravely damaged. A person is destroyed by the inner conviction of uselessness. No amount of economic growth can compensate for such losses. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">None of these awesome problems figure in the cosy theories of most of our development economists. The failure of the first development decade is attributed simply to an insufficiency of aid appropriations or to certain alleged defects inherent in the societies and populations of the developing countries. The decisive question was whether aid was dispensed multilaterally or bilaterally, or whether an improvement in the terms of trade for primary commodities, a removal of trade barriers, guarantees for private investors, or the effective introduction of birth control, were the only things that really mattered. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Now, these items are not irrelevant, but they do not seem to go to the heart of the matter, viz, the fact that world poverty is primarily a problem of two million villages. The solution cannot be found in the cities of the poor countries. Unless life in the hinterland can be made tolerable, the problem of world poverty is insoluble and will worsen. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">All important insights are missed if we continue to think of development mainly in quantitative terms. Aid can be considered successful only if it helps to mobilise the labour-power of the masses in the receiving country and raises productivity without &#39;saving&#39; labour. The common criterion of success, namely the growth of GNP, is utterly misleading and, in fact, must of necessity lead to &#39;neocolonialism&#39;. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This term appears to imply a deliberate intention on the part of the aid- givers. But there is no such intention. This makes the problem greater instead of smaller. Unintentional neo-colonialism is more insidious and infinitely more difficult to combat than neo-colonialism intentionally pursued. It results from the mere drift of things, supported by the best intentions. Methods of production, standards of consumption, criteria of success or failure, systems of values and behaviour patterns establish themselves in poor countries which, being (doubtfully) appropriate only to conditions of affluence already achieved, fix the poor countries ever more inescapably in a condition of utter dependence on the rich.

If it is people -- which particular people? Where are they? Why do they need help? Concern with people raises countless questions. Goods do not raise many questions. Particularly when econometricians deal with them, goods cease to be anything identifiable, and become GNP, imports, exports, savings, investment, infrastructure. Impressive models can be built out of these abstractions, but they do not leave room for actual people. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It is much easier to deal with goods than with people. Those who need help are poor, uneducated, and village-based. The helpers are rich, educated and town-based. Three tremendous gulfs separate them: the gulf between rich and poor; the gulf between educated and uneducated; and the gulf between city-men and country-folk. The first problem of development aid is how to bridge these gulfs. The methods of production, the patterns of consumption, the systems of ideas that suit relatively affluent, educated city people are unlikely to suit poor, semi-illiterate peasants. If the people cannot adapt themselves to the methods, then the methods must be adapted to the people. This is the whole crux of the matter. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">There are many questionable features of the rich man&#39;s economy: successful adaptation of poor communities to these features would spell ruin.
