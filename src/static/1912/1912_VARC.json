Those half-beams, now out of step, will then interfere with each other at the detector in a way that tells of their experience.

That slice, called GW150914 by LIGO&rsquo;s masters, is the first gravitational wave to be detected directly. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The idea of gravitational waves emerged from the general theory of relativity, Albert Einstein&rsquo;s fundamental exposition of gravity, unveiled 100 years before GW150914&rsquo;s discovery. Mass, Einstein realised, deforms the space and time around itself. Gravity is the effect of this, the behaviour of objects dutifully moving along the curves of mass-warped spacetime. It is a simple idea, but the equations that give it mathematical heft are hard to solve. One approximation led Einstein to an odd prediction: any accelerating mass should make ripples in spacetime. Einstein would argue for such waves and then, after redoing the sums, against them. But, while many stretched and squeezed the maths, experimentalists set about trying to catch the putative waves in the act of stretching and squeezing matter. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Their problem was that the expected effect was a transient change in dimensions equivalent to perhaps a thousandth of the width of a proton in an apparatus several kilometres across. Indirect proof of gravitational waves&rsquo; existence has been found, most notably by measuring radio emissions from pairs of dead stars called pulsars that are orbiting one another, and deducing from this how the distance between them is shrinking as they broadcast gravitational waves into the cosmos. But the waves themselves proved elusive until the construction of LIGO. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">LIGO is an interferometer and works by splitting a laser beam in two, sending the halves to and fro along paths identical in length but set at right angles to one another, and then looking for interference patterns when the halves are recombined. If the half-beams&rsquo; paths are undisturbed, the waves will arrive at the detector in lock-step. But a passing gravitational wave will alternately stretch and compress the half-beams&rsquo; paths. Those half-beams, now out of step, will then interfere with each other at the detector in a way that tells of their experience. The shape of the resulting interference pattern contains information about the wave&rsquo;s source, including what masses were involved and how far away it was. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">To make absolutely certain that what is seen really is a gravitational wave requires taking great care. First, LIGO is actually two facilities, one in Louisiana and the other in Washington. The tiny shifts in the length of their arms are continually compared and significant patterns which appear to arise synchronously are followed up to determine whether a gravitational wave may have been detected or if some other cause was responsible. Between 2002 when LIGO opened and 2010, when it was closed for upgrades, nary a wave was seen. In 2015, Advanced LIGO, which was four times as sensitive as the previous incarnation began its work. The system&rsquo;s operators were still kicking its metaphorical tyres and had yet to begin its official first run when GW150914 turned up, first at the Louisiana site, and about a hundredth of a second later in Washington. The likelihood that the signal was a fluke is infinitesimal. Four more observations of gravitational waves were made in 2017, including GW170817, the first observed merger of binary neutron stars, which was also observed in electromagnetic radiation. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">For gravitational astronomy, this is just the beginning. Soon, LIGO will not be alone but it will be accompanied by four other observatories. Together, by forming a telescope that will permit astronomers to pinpoint whence the waves come, these devices will open a new vista on the universe. As technology improves, waves of lower frequency - corresponding to events involving larger masses - will become detectable. Eventually, astronomers should be able to peer at the first 380,000 years after the Big Bang, an epoch of history that remains inaccessible to every other kind of telescope yet designed. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The real prize, though, lies in proving Einstein wrong.

Tourists who watch women ____________(ii)_____________ floating markets over baskets of mangosteen and fresh fish, or who see peasants in conical hats farming paddies by hand, imagine that they are witnessing something timeless - life as it always has been, its rhythms dictated by seasons, land and sea. But though it seems they are witnessing a pastoral, what they are seeing is in fact the opening scene of a tragedy: the part where the characters act as they always have, but their fate ____________(iii)_____________. Life as it has been is not life as it will be.

With no great expanse of fertile soil or abundance of mineral resources they succeeded in developing a higher and more varied civilization than any of the most richly favoured nations of the Near East. With only a limited cultural inheritance from the past to build upon, they produced intellectual and artistic achievements which have served ever since as models of perfection for the culture of the West. It may be argued as well that the Greeks achieved a more leisured and rational mode of living than most other peoples who strutted and fretted their hour upon this planet. The infrequence of brutal crimes and the contentment with simple amusements and modest wealth all point to a comparatively happy and satisfied experience.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It is necessary to be on guard, however, against uncritical adulation of the ancient Greeks. We must not assume that all of the natives of Hellas were as cultured, wise, and free as the citizens of Athens and of the Ionian states across the Aegean. The Spartans, the Arcadians, the Thessalians, and the majority of the Boeotians remained much less culturally advanced. Further, Athenian civilization itself was not without its defects. It permitted some exploitation of the weak, especially of the slaves who toiled in the mines. It was based upon a principle of racial exclusiveness which reckoned every man a foreigner whose parents were not both Athenians, and consequently denied political rights to the majority of the inhabitants. It was also characterized by the overt repression of the female members of the society. Its statecraft was not sufficiently enlightened to avoid the pitfalls of imperialism and aggressive war. Finally, the attitude of its citizens was not always tolerant and just. Socrates was put to death for his opinions, and two other philosophers, Anaxagoras and Protagoras, were forced to leave the city. It must be conceded, however, that the record of the Athenians for tolerance was better than that of most other nations, both ancient and modern. There was probably more freedom of expression in Athens during the war with Sparta than there was in the United States during World War I.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Nor is it true that the Greek influence has been as great as is often supposed. No well-informed student could accept the sentimental verdict of Shelley: \u201cWe are all Greeks; our laws, our literature, our religion, our arts have their roots in Greece.\u201d Our laws do not really have their roots in Greece but chiefly in Hellenistic and Roman sources. Our religion is no more than partly Greek except, as it was influenced by Plato and the Romans, it reflects primarily the spirit of the Near East. Even our arts derive from other sources almost as much as from Greece. Actually, modern civilization has been the result of the convergence of numerous influences coming from many different periods and places. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In spite of all this, the Hellenic adventure was of profound significance for the history of the world. For the Greeks were the founders of nearly all those ideals commonly thought of as peculiar to the West. Culture in the Near Eastern empires served mainly as an instrument to magnify the power of the state and to enhance the prestige of rulers and priests. The civilizations of the ancient Near East, with the exception, to a certain extent, of the Hebrew and Egyptian, were dominated by absolutism, supernaturalism, ecclesiasticism, the denial of both body and mind, and the subjection of the individual to the group. In contrast, the civilization of Greece, was founded upon ideals of freedom, optimism, secularism, rationalism, the glorification of both body and mind, and a high regard for the dignity and worth of the individual. The culture of the Greeks was the first to be based upon the primacy of intellect - upon the supremacy of the spirit of free inquiry. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The supreme tragedy of the Greeks was, of course, their failure to solve the problem of political conflict. This conflict was the product of social and cultural dissimilarities. Not even the danger of Asian conquest sufficed to dispel the distrust and antagonism of Greeks for one another. Thus, the war that finally broke out between Athens and Sparta sealed the doom of Hellenic civilization even though Greece remained undefeated by foreigners. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1912"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu17":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The author mentions Anaxagoras and Protagoras in the passage to drive home which of the following ideas?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>To show that the record of Athenians for tolerance was at least better than most other nations.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>To demonstrate that most of the inhabitants were denied political rights owing to their lineage.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>To show that while Socrates was put to death, some thinkers escaped a similar fate.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>To suggest that Athenians intermittently demonstrated intolerance.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"d","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"6105","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>6<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>1<\/i><i>:<\/i> The passage given below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

With no great expanse of fertile soil or abundance of mineral resources they succeeded in developing a higher and more varied civilization than any of the most richly favoured nations of the Near East. With only a limited cultural inheritance from the past to build upon, they produced intellectual and artistic achievements which have served ever since as models of perfection for the culture of the West. It may be argued as well that the Greeks achieved a more leisured and rational mode of living than most other peoples who strutted and fretted their hour upon this planet. The infrequence of brutal crimes and the contentment with simple amusements and modest wealth all point to a comparatively happy and satisfied experience.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">It is necessary to be on guard, however, against uncritical adulation of the ancient Greeks. We must not assume that all of the natives of Hellas were as cultured, wise, and free as the citizens of Athens and of the Ionian states across the Aegean. The Spartans, the Arcadians, the Thessalians, and the majority of the Boeotians remained much less culturally advanced. Further, Athenian civilization itself was not without its defects. It permitted some exploitation of the weak, especially of the slaves who toiled in the mines. It was based upon a principle of racial exclusiveness which reckoned every man a foreigner whose parents were not both Athenians, and consequently denied political rights to the majority of the inhabitants. It was also characterized by the overt repression of the female members of the society. Its statecraft was not sufficiently enlightened to avoid the pitfalls of imperialism and aggressive war. Finally, the attitude of its citizens was not always tolerant and just. Socrates was put to death for his opinions, and two other philosophers, Anaxagoras and Protagoras, were forced to leave the city. It must be conceded, however, that the record of the Athenians for tolerance was better than that of most other nations, both ancient and modern. There was probably more freedom of expression in Athens during the war with Sparta than there was in the United States during World War I.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Nor is it true that the Greek influence has been as great as is often supposed. No well-informed student could accept the sentimental verdict of Shelley: \u201cWe are all Greeks; our laws, our literature, our religion, our arts have their roots in Greece.\u201d Our laws do not really have their roots in Greece but chiefly in Hellenistic and Roman sources. Our religion is no more than partly Greek except, as it was influenced by Plato and the Romans, it reflects primarily the spirit of the Near East. Even our arts derive from other sources almost as much as from Greece. Actually, modern civilization has been the result of the convergence of numerous influences coming from many different periods and places. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In spite of all this, the Hellenic adventure was of profound significance for the history of the world. For the Greeks were the founders of nearly all those ideals commonly thought of as peculiar to the West. Culture in the Near Eastern empires served mainly as an instrument to magnify the power of the state and to enhance the prestige of rulers and priests. The civilizations of the ancient Near East, with the exception, to a certain extent, of the Hebrew and Egyptian, were dominated by absolutism, supernaturalism, ecclesiasticism, the denial of both body and mind, and the subjection of the individual to the group. In contrast, the civilization of Greece, was founded upon ideals of freedom, optimism, secularism, rationalism, the glorification of both body and mind, and a high regard for the dignity and worth of the individual. The culture of the Greeks was the first to be based upon the primacy of intellect - upon the supremacy of the spirit of free inquiry. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The supreme tragedy of the Greeks was, of course, their failure to solve the problem of political conflict. This conflict was the product of social and cultural dissimilarities. Not even the danger of Asian conquest sufficed to dispel the distrust and antagonism of Greeks for one another. Thus, the war that finally broke out between Athens and Sparta sealed the doom of Hellenic civilization even though Greece remained undefeated by foreigners. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1912"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu22":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>2<\/i><i> <\/i><i>a<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>d<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>3<\/i><i>:<\/i><b> <\/b>Each of the following questions has a paragraph from which the last sentence has been deleted.

The company completely monopolized trade in four countries, had worldwide interests ranging from coffee and woollens to opium, had its own private army and navy, was empowered by the crown to declare war when its business interests were threatened, and effectively ruled over a fifth of the world&rsquo;s population. The British East Indian Company surely would have been at the top of any &lsquo;most admired and feared companies&rsquo; list in its day. Yet, despite all its economies of scale and scope, its barriers to competition, its privileged relationships and its many core competencies, such as brutally oppressing the natives, its massive wall of competitive advantage crumbled in the face of technological innovation and the entry of new competitors, and in 1873, the company went out of business. Although, the British East India Company had a good, long run, in the end, the world changed and it didn&rsquo;t. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">All competitive advantage is temporary. Some advantages last longer than others, but all sources of advantage have a finite shelf life. While this may sound like a truism, the observation is often forgotten in the never-ending quest for &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; companies that build sustainable competitive advantages and allegedly outperform their industry peers, year after year. There are books which tell the inspiring stories of such great companies, what they did to succeed, and how if your company does the same things they did, it can be a great company too. There are also &lsquo;Why great companies fail&rsquo; books, which tell the terrifying stories of how big, once-successful companies blew it; of how industry-changing innovations, cumbersome bureaucracy, and hubris caused once-mighty institutions to go down in flames. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fascinating thing about all these books is that the same companies show up on both sides of the shelf. Apple, for example, has traversed the full length of the bookshelf, starting off as a young up-and-comer moving into &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; territory, then shifting to &lsquo;blew it&rsquo; and now has moved back to the &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; side with its successes under Steve Jobs. A shockingly large number of companies which featured in the original lists of &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; companies though, have fallen into bankruptcy, breakup or acquisition exemplified by Enron which blew itself up in spectacular and tragic fashion in 2002. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But while many companies fail, surely there must be some &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; companies that have built sustainable competitive advantages and maintained high levels of performance over long periods. Dick Foster and Sarah Kaplan, examine this question in their book <i>C<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>v<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>D<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i> by looking at the oldest league table in business, the Forbes 100. In 1917, Bertie Forbes, the founder of Forbes magazine, published his first Forbes 100 list of the largest US companies. In 1987, the magazine republished the original list and asked, &lsquo;Where are they now?&rsquo; The majority of the one-hundred companies on the original list, sixty-one, had in one way or another ceased to exist, either merging into other companies or going bankrupt. Of the survivors, twenty-one had dropped out of the top hundred, and only eighteen, including such venerable names as Procter &amp; Gamble, Exxon, and Citibank, were still in the elite group. These eighteen companies, as Foster and Kaplan note, were grand-champion survivors, weathering the storms of the Great Depression, World War II, the inflationary 1970s, the merger-and-acquisition turmoil of the 1980s, and the technology revolution of the 1990s. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So, they must be great performers, the truly &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; companies, right? Wrong. With the exception of GE and Kodak, every one of them underperformed the average growth in stock market value during that seventy-year period, and since 1987, Kodak&rsquo;s performance has dropped off as well, leaving GE the sole original Forbes 100 company to survive and outperform the market over the past eight decades. As another reference point, Foster and Kaplan also looked at the five hundred companies that started in the S&amp;P 500, when it was formed in 1957, and found that only seventy-four survived until 1997. Moreover, as a group, the seventy-four survivors underperformed the overall S&amp;P 500 index by 20 percent. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Taken together and viewed over a longer time frame, the story the &lsquo;excellent company&rsquo; books tell is not one of sustainable competitive advantage and enduring high performance. Rather, it is a story of the ephemeral nature of competitive advantage, and the incredible dynamism of markets as companies rise and fall. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1912_5"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu30":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>In the line \u2018With the exception of GE and Kodak, every one of them underperformed the average growth in stock market value during that seventy-year period\u2019 (para 5), the author is trying to negate which of the following assumptions?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Companies which weathered the Great Depression, World War II and the technology revolution are \u2018excellent\u2019 companies.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Companies which are grand-champion survivors are great performers. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Only the truly excellent companies survive across ages without succumbing to innovations, inflation and depressions. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Most companies in the original Forbes 100 list dropped off the radar a few decades later.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"6107","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>9<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>3<\/i><i>4<\/i><i>:<\/i> The passage given below is accompanied by a set of six questions.

These eighteen companies, as Foster and Kaplan note, were grand-champion survivors, weathering the storms of the Great Depression, World War II, the inflationary 1970s, the merger-and-acquisition turmoil of the 1980s, and the technology revolution of the 1990s. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So, they must be great performers, the truly &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; companies, right? Wrong. With the exception of GE and Kodak, every one of them underperformed the average growth in stock market value during that seventy-year period, and since 1987, Kodak&rsquo;s performance has dropped off as well, leaving GE the sole original Forbes 100 company to survive and outperform the market over the past eight decades. As another reference point, Foster and Kaplan also looked at the five hundred companies that started in the S&amp;P 500, when it was formed in 1957, and found that only seventy-four survived until 1997. Moreover, as a group, the seventy-four survivors underperformed the overall S&amp;P 500 index by 20 percent. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Taken together and viewed over a longer time frame, the story the &lsquo;excellent company&rsquo; books tell is not one of sustainable competitive advantage and enduring high performance.

Choose the best answer to each question. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>I<\/b>n the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the British East India Company had the mother-of-all strategic positions. The company completely monopolized trade in four countries, had worldwide interests ranging from coffee and woollens to opium, had its own private army and navy, was empowered by the crown to declare war when its business interests were threatened, and effectively ruled over a fifth of the world&rsquo;s population. The British East Indian Company surely would have been at the top of any &lsquo;most admired and feared companies&rsquo; list in its day. Yet, despite all its economies of scale and scope, its barriers to competition, its privileged relationships and its many core competencies, such as brutally oppressing the natives, its massive wall of competitive advantage crumbled in the face of technological innovation and the entry of new competitors, and in 1873, the company went out of business. Although, the British East India Company had a good, long run, in the end, the world changed and it didn&rsquo;t. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">All competitive advantage is temporary. Some advantages last longer than others, but all sources of advantage have a finite shelf life. While this may sound like a truism, the observation is often forgotten in the never-ending quest for &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; companies that build sustainable competitive advantages and allegedly outperform their industry peers, year after year. There are books which tell the inspiring stories of such great companies, what they did to succeed, and how if your company does the same things they did, it can be a great company too. There are also &lsquo;Why great companies fail&rsquo; books, which tell the terrifying stories of how big, once-successful companies blew it; of how industry-changing innovations, cumbersome bureaucracy, and hubris caused once-mighty institutions to go down in flames. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The fascinating thing about all these books is that the same companies show up on both sides of the shelf. Apple, for example, has traversed the full length of the bookshelf, starting off as a young up-and-comer moving into &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; territory, then shifting to &lsquo;blew it&rsquo; and now has moved back to the &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; side with its successes under Steve Jobs. A shockingly large number of companies which featured in the original lists of &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; companies though, have fallen into bankruptcy, breakup or acquisition exemplified by Enron which blew itself up in spectacular and tragic fashion in 2002. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But while many companies fail, surely there must be some &lsquo;excellent&rsquo; companies that have built sustainable competitive advantages and maintained high levels of performance over long periods. Dick Foster and Sarah Kaplan, examine this question in their book <i>C<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>a<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>v<\/i><i>e<\/i><i> <\/i><i>D<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>r<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>c<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i> by looking at the oldest league table in business, the Forbes 100. In 1917, Bertie Forbes, the founder of Forbes magazine, published his first Forbes 100 list of the largest US companies. In 1987, the magazine republished the original list and asked, &lsquo;Where are they now?&rsquo; The majority of the one-hundred companies on the original list, sixty-one, had in one way or another ceased to exist, either merging into other companies or going bankrupt.
