Haphazard enforcement that includes fines or jail time, employer abuses and public resentment do little to dissuade jobseekers. Most voluntarily set out on long journeys, counting on jobs nonexistent in their homelands and anticipating tedious, revolting or dangerous work. Shelley reveals that people jump through hoops of horror to live in lands that offer opportunity. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Yet the typical reader who picks up this book doesn\u2019t need to be convinced about the exploitation, and the book will disappoint those who long for a specific plan of action. For now, ordinary citizens can only read about the rising inequality and degrading values that accompany a two-tier class society, one group with \u201crights\u201d and the other without. ...\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In a world with national borders, governments easily claim that the newcomers from other countries have \u201cno rights,\u201d so the migrants become a convenient foe in the politics of enforcement. According to Shelley, employers, large and small, take advantage of undocumented workers willing to toil for low wages. The skilled native is able to focus on the most valuable tasks like skilled work and customer relations, while the immigrants with limited education focus on support tasks but help bring the price down for the overall project. Yet the wealthy respond as though their communities are under attack by those fleeing poverty in their homelands.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">That attitude \u2212 wealthy nation as victim \u2212 suggests that the labor is not forced, that the workers don\u2019t mind a lack of standing in communities, reinforcing an illusion of fairness in what is essentially a class system. \u201cTrade liberalization\u2026 has created a bigger pool of people desperate to improve their circumstances through migration, while simultaneously the pressures of competing with lower-cost rivals abroad may have made employers in some sectors more likely to take on cheaper, undocumented labour,\u201d notes Shelley. The employers claim to value the migrants\u2019 worth ethic, otherwise known as a willingness to accept low pay and horrendous conditions. \u201cThe \u2018hunger\u2019 for work, the \u2018reliability\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 of migrant labour are employers\u2019 terms for long hours, lack of overtime pay, unpaid duties, zero hour contracts\u2026 and disposability of migrant labour.\u201d\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">A government enforcement policy that focuses more on immigration status than workplace rights sets the stage for abuse of all workers, and Shelley concludes that \u201cthe government has chosen to promote a narrative in which migration is associated with law and order rather than rights.\u201d\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">A strong point in Shelley\u2019s book is its exposure of the blatant unfairness of point-based systems that create classes of workers with different sets of rights, institutionalizing inequality and encouraging criminality. \u201cExperience shows that the more managed, restricted and hedged about with regulatory barbed wire a migrant labour is, the less control authorities have over it,\u201d Shelley notes. ...\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Shelley argues for decriminalization of immigration, focusing less on raids and more on workplace rights, and effective <b>\u2018<\/b><b>naturalization\u2019 <\/b>norms and notes that open borders \u2212 eliminating the undocumented status \u2212 could do more than closed borders in reducing the extreme wage inequality between borders.

According to Shelley, employers, large and small, take advantage of undocumented workers willing to toil for low wages. The skilled native is able to focus on the most valuable tasks like skilled work and customer relations, while the immigrants with limited education focus on support tasks but help bring the price down for the overall project.

The employers claim to value the migrants\u2019 worth ethic, otherwise known as a willingness to accept low pay and horrendous conditions. \u201cThe \u2018hunger\u2019 for work, the \u2018reliability\u2019 and \u2018flexibility\u2019 of migrant labour are employers\u2019 terms for long hours, lack of overtime pay, unpaid duties, zero hour contracts\u2026 and disposability of migrant labour.\u201d\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">A government enforcement policy that focuses more on immigration status than workplace rights sets the stage for abuse of all workers, and Shelley concludes that \u201cthe government has chosen to promote a narrative in which migration is associated with law and order rather than rights.\u201d\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">A strong point in Shelley\u2019s book is its exposure of the blatant unfairness of point-based systems that create classes of workers with different sets of rights, institutionalizing inequality and encouraging criminality. \u201cExperience shows that the more managed, restricted and hedged about with regulatory barbed wire a migrant labour is, the less control authorities have over it,\u201d Shelley notes. ...\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Shelley argues for decriminalization of immigration, focusing less on raids and more on workplace rights, and effective <b>\u2018<\/b><b>naturalization\u2019 <\/b>norms and notes that open borders \u2212 eliminating the undocumented status \u2212 could do more than closed borders in reducing the extreme wage inequality between borders.

There is nothing imaginary in the common acceptation of the word. The logic of Moses in the <i>Vicar <\/i><i>of <\/i><i>Wakefield <\/i>is good argument here: &minus; &ldquo;Whatever is, is.&rdquo; Whatever touches us, whatever moves us, does touch and does move us. We recognize the reality of it, as we do that of a hand in the dark. We might as well say that a sight which makes us laugh, or a blow which brings tears into our eyes, is imaginary, as that anything else is imaginary that makes us laugh or weep. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">We can only judge of things by their effects. Our perception constantly deceives us, in things with which we suppose ourselves perfectly conversant; but our reception of their effect is a different matter. Whether we are materialists or immaterialists, whether things be about us or within us, whether we think the sun is a substance, or only the image of a divine thought, an idea, a thing imaginary, we are equally agreed as to the notion of its warmth. But, as this warmth is felt differently by different temperaments, so what we call imaginary things affect different minds. What we have to do is not to deny their effect, because we do not feel in the same proportion, or whether we even feel it at all; but to see whether our neighbors may not be moved. If they are, there is, to all intents and purposes, a moving cause. But we do not see it? No; &minus; neither perhaps do they. They only feel it; they are only sentient, &minus; a word which implies the sight given to the imagination by the feelings. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But what do you mean, we may ask in return, by seeing? Some rays of light come in contact with the eye; they bring a sensation to it; in a word, they touch it; and the impression left by this touch we call sight. How far does this differ in effect from the impression left by any other touch, however mysterious? An ox knocked down by a butcher, and a man knocked down by a fit of apoplexy, equally feel themselves compelled to drop. The tickling of a straw and of a comedy equally move the muscles about the mouth. The look of a beloved eye will so thrill the frame, that old philosophers have had recourse to a doctrine of beams and radiant particles flying from one sight to another. In fine, what is contact itself, and why does it affect us? There is no one cause more mysterious than another, if we look into it. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Nor does the question concern us like moral causes. ... If, instead of saying that the causes which moved in us this or that pain or pleasure were imaginary, people were to say that the causes themselves were removable, they would be nearer the truth. When a stone trips us up, we do not fall to disputing its existence: we put it out of the way. When we suffer from what is called an imaginary pain, our business is not to canvass the reality of it. Whether there is any cause or not in that or any other perception, or whether everything consists not in what is called effect, it is sufficient for us that the effect is real. Our sole business is to remove those second causes, which always accompany the original idea. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">As in deliriums, for instance, it would be idle to go about persuading the patient that he did not behold the figures he says he does. He might reasonably ask us, if he could, how we know anything about the matter; or how we can be sure that in the infinite wonders of the universe certain realities may not become apparent to certain eyes, whether diseased or not. There is no one cause more mysterious than another. Our business would be to put him into that state of health in which human beings are not diverted from their comforts by a liability to such imaginations. We could explain that such a morbidity is clearly no more a fit state for a human being than a disarranged state of works is for a watch; and that seeing the general tendency of nature to this completeness or state of comfort, we naturally conclude that the imaginations in question are at least not of the same lasting or prevailing description. <\/font><\/span><\/p>",

height: 88px;\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">There is not a more unthinking way of talking than to say such and such pains and pleasures are only imaginary, and therefore to be got rid of or under-valued accordingly. There is nothing imaginary in the common acceptation of the word. The logic of Moses in the <i>Vicar <\/i><i>of <\/i><i>Wakefield <\/i>is good argument here: &minus; &ldquo;Whatever is, is.&rdquo; Whatever touches us, whatever moves us, does touch and does move us. We recognize the reality of it, as we do that of a hand in the dark. We might as well say that a sight which makes us laugh, or a blow which brings tears into our eyes, is imaginary, as that anything else is imaginary that makes us laugh or weep. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">We can only judge of things by their effects. Our perception constantly deceives us, in things with which we suppose ourselves perfectly conversant; but our reception of their effect is a different matter. Whether we are materialists or immaterialists, whether things be about us or within us, whether we think the sun is a substance, or only the image of a divine thought, an idea, a thing imaginary, we are equally agreed as to the notion of its warmth. But, as this warmth is felt differently by different temperaments, so what we call imaginary things affect different minds. What we have to do is not to deny their effect, because we do not feel in the same proportion, or whether we even feel it at all; but to see whether our neighbors may not be moved. If they are, there is, to all intents and purposes, a moving cause. But we do not see it? No; &minus; neither perhaps do they. They only feel it; they are only sentient, &minus; a word which implies the sight given to the imagination by the feelings. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But what do you mean, we may ask in return, by seeing? Some rays of light come in contact with the eye; they bring a sensation to it; in a word, they touch it; and the impression left by this touch we call sight. How far does this differ in effect from the impression left by any other touch, however mysterious? An ox knocked down by a butcher, and a man knocked down by a fit of apoplexy, equally feel themselves compelled to drop. The tickling of a straw and of a comedy equally move the muscles about the mouth. The look of a beloved eye will so thrill the frame, that old philosophers have had recourse to a doctrine of beams and radiant particles flying from one sight to another. In fine, what is contact itself, and why does it affect us? There is no one cause more mysterious than another, if we look into it. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Nor does the question concern us like moral causes. ... If, instead of saying that the causes which moved in us this or that pain or pleasure were imaginary, people were to say that the causes themselves were removable, they would be nearer the truth. When a stone trips us up, we do not fall to disputing its existence: we put it out of the way. When we suffer from what is called an imaginary pain, our business is not to canvass the reality of it. Whether there is any cause or not in that or any other perception, or whether everything consists not in what is called effect, it is sufficient for us that the effect is real. Our sole business is to remove those second causes, which always accompany the original idea. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">As in deliriums, for instance, it would be idle to go about persuading the patient that he did not behold the figures he says he does. He might reasonably ask us, if he could, how we know anything about the matter; or how we can be sure that in the infinite wonders of the universe certain realities may not become apparent to certain eyes, whether diseased or not. There is no one cause more mysterious than another. Our business would be to put him into that state of health in which human beings are not diverted from their comforts by a liability to such imaginations. We could explain that such a morbidity is clearly no more a fit state for a human being than a disarranged state of works is for a watch; and that seeing the general tendency of nature to this completeness or state of comfort, we naturally conclude that the imaginations in question are at least not of the same lasting or prevailing description. <\/font><\/span><\/p>",

There is nothing imaginary in the common acceptation of the word. The logic of Moses in the <i>Vicar <\/i><i>of <\/i><i>Wakefield <\/i>is good argument here: &minus; &ldquo;Whatever is, is.&rdquo; Whatever touches us, whatever moves us, does touch and does move us. We recognize the reality of it, as we do that of a hand in the dark. We might as well say that a sight which makes us laugh, or a blow which brings tears into our eyes, is imaginary, as that anything else is imaginary that makes us laugh or weep. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">We can only judge of things by their effects. Our perception constantly deceives us, in things with which we suppose ourselves perfectly conversant; but our reception of their effect is a different matter. Whether we are materialists or immaterialists, whether things be about us or within us, whether we think the sun is a substance, or only the image of a divine thought, an idea, a thing imaginary, we are equally agreed as to the notion of its warmth. But, as this warmth is felt differently by different temperaments, so what we call imaginary things affect different minds. What we have to do is not to deny their effect, because we do not feel in the same proportion, or whether we even feel it at all; but to see whether our neighbors may not be moved. If they are, there is, to all intents and purposes, a moving cause. But we do not see it? No; &minus; neither perhaps do they. They only feel it; they are only sentient, &minus; a word which implies the sight given to the imagination by the feelings. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But what do you mean, we may ask in return, by seeing? Some rays of light come in contact with the eye; they bring a sensation to it; in a word, they touch it; and the impression left by this touch we call sight. How far does this differ in effect from the impression left by any other touch, however mysterious? An ox knocked down by a butcher, and a man knocked down by a fit of apoplexy, equally feel themselves compelled to drop. The tickling of a straw and of a comedy equally move the muscles about the mouth. The look of a beloved eye will so thrill the frame, that old philosophers have had recourse to a doctrine of beams and radiant particles flying from one sight to another. In fine, what is contact itself, and why does it affect us? There is no one cause more mysterious than another, if we look into it. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Nor does the question concern us like moral causes. ... If, instead of saying that the causes which moved in us this or that pain or pleasure were imaginary, people were to say that the causes themselves were removable, they would be nearer the truth. When a stone trips us up, we do not fall to disputing its existence: we put it out of the way. When we suffer from what is called an imaginary pain, our business is not to canvass the reality of it. Whether there is any cause or not in that or any other perception, or whether everything consists not in what is called effect, it is sufficient for us that the effect is real. Our sole business is to remove those second causes, which always accompany the original idea. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">As in deliriums, for instance, it would be idle to go about persuading the patient that he did not behold the figures he says he does. He might reasonably ask us, if he could, how we know anything about the matter; or how we can be sure that in the infinite wonders of the universe certain realities may not become apparent to certain eyes, whether diseased or not. There is no one cause more mysterious than another. Our business would be to put him into that state of health in which human beings are not diverted from their comforts by a liability to such imaginations. We could explain that such a morbidity is clearly no more a fit state for a human being than a disarranged state of works is for a watch; and that seeing the general tendency of nature to this completeness or state of comfort, we naturally conclude that the imaginations in question are at least not of the same lasting or prevailing description. <\/font><\/span><\/p>",

When a stone trips us up, we do not fall to disputing its existence: we put it out of the way. When we suffer from what is called an imaginary pain, our business is not to canvass the reality of it. Whether there is any cause or not in that or any other perception, or whether everything consists not in what is called effect, it is sufficient for us that the effect is real. Our sole business is to remove those second causes, which always accompany the original idea. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">As in deliriums, for instance, it would be idle to go about persuading the patient that he did not behold the figures he says he does.

There is no one cause more mysterious than another. Our business would be to put him into that state of health in which human beings are not diverted from their comforts by a liability to such imaginations. We could explain that such a morbidity is clearly no more a fit state for a human being than a disarranged state of works is for a watch; and that seeing the general tendency of nature to this completeness or state of comfort, we naturally conclude that the imaginations in question are at least not of the same lasting or prevailing description. <\/font><\/span><\/p>",

height: 88px;\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">There is not a more unthinking way of talking than to say such and such pains and pleasures are only imaginary, and therefore to be got rid of or under-valued accordingly. There is nothing imaginary in the common acceptation of the word. The logic of Moses in the <i>Vicar <\/i><i>of <\/i><i>Wakefield <\/i>is good argument here: &minus; &ldquo;Whatever is, is.&rdquo; Whatever touches us, whatever moves us, does touch and does move us. We recognize the reality of it, as we do that of a hand in the dark. We might as well say that a sight which makes us laugh, or a blow which brings tears into our eyes, is imaginary, as that anything else is imaginary that makes us laugh or weep. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">We can only judge of things by their effects. Our perception constantly deceives us, in things with which we suppose ourselves perfectly conversant; but our reception of their effect is a different matter. Whether we are materialists or immaterialists, whether things be about us or within us, whether we think the sun is a substance, or only the image of a divine thought, an idea, a thing imaginary, we are equally agreed as to the notion of its warmth. But, as this warmth is felt differently by different temperaments, so what we call imaginary things affect different minds. What we have to do is not to deny their effect, because we do not feel in the same proportion, or whether we even feel it at all; but to see whether our neighbors may not be moved. If they are, there is, to all intents and purposes, a moving cause. But we do not see it? No; &minus; neither perhaps do they. They only feel it; they are only sentient, &minus; a word which implies the sight given to the imagination by the feelings. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But what do you mean, we may ask in return, by seeing? Some rays of light come in contact with the eye; they bring a sensation to it; in a word, they touch it; and the impression left by this touch we call sight. How far does this differ in effect from the impression left by any other touch, however mysterious? An ox knocked down by a butcher, and a man knocked down by a fit of apoplexy, equally feel themselves compelled to drop. The tickling of a straw and of a comedy equally move the muscles about the mouth. The look of a beloved eye will so thrill the frame, that old philosophers have had recourse to a doctrine of beams and radiant particles flying from one sight to another. In fine, what is contact itself, and why does it affect us? There is no one cause more mysterious than another, if we look into it. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Nor does the question concern us like moral causes. ...

So why do we need to sleep? It surprises most people to learn that this is even a question. Every other basic bodily function \u2212 like eating, drinking, breathing or urinating \u2212 has a pretty clear purpose. Our bodies and brains need food, water, and oxygen to stay alive and to replenish themselves, and if they didn\"t rid themselves of the byproducts of this metabolism, we\"d be awash in our own toxic waste. Likewise, sleep must be required for something important. We all spend decades in this strange state, immobilized, unconscious, and vulnerable. But what exactly does sleep do for us?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Parents tell their children they need to sleep because they\"re tired and require rest. But, of course, mere \u2018rest\u2019 is not good enough. Lying still for eight hours is no substitute for sleep. My own mother had a different theory. She said I needed to sleep because I had too much \"sleepy gas.\" It had been building up all day long, and so I needed to sleep to get rid of it. In fact, scientists observed a long time ago that if you keep a sheep awake continuously for several days and then inject some of its cerebrospinal fluid into another, well-rested sheep, that sheep will fall right asleep, presumably because some naturally-occurring sleep substance had reached a soporific level in the donor. But this line of research never quite solved the puzzle. Although a number of putative sleep substances have now been identified, we\"re not sure how they might work biochemically, or how sleep (as opposed to mere rest) might break them down.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Other sleep-deprivation studies done in the early 1980s took a more brutal approach. Rats were kept awake for weeks until they died from a lack of sleep. One then investigated the precise cause of death. Such studies (now outlawed) could not pinpoint any specific culprits, such as particular organ failures. One striking observation, however, was that the rats ate much more than normal and yet wasted away. Their metabolism seemed to be wrecked. So maybe sleep is required for energy regulation, in some unspecified way. Other popular theories are that sleep is required for tissue repair, or immune function, or for consolidating learning and memory.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The new development, and the cause for optimism, is an original approach to the problem that makes the first quantitative, testable predictions about the function of sleep. Two physicists, Van Savage of Harvard Medical School and Geoff West of Santa Fe Institute, have analyzed how sleep varies across mammals of different species. Normally physiological time ticks slower for bigger animals. For example, elephants live much longer than mice and their hearts beat much slower. The interesting thing is that the lifetimes and pulse times of both elephants and mice scale in the same way with their body mass \u2212 in direct proportion to their mass raised to the 1\/4 power \u2212 with the curious implication that the hearts of mice and elephants will typically beat the same number of times in their lifetime.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">What is so strange about sleep in this regard is that it behaves differently from all other physiological times. It\"s backward. Mice sleep longer than elephants, not shorter \u2212 about fourteen hours a day compared to four. Savage and West interpret this as evidence that sleep is related to cellular repair. They note that cells produce destructive byproducts, such as free radicals, in the course of normal metabolism, and they hypothesize that sleep somehow helps repair the damage that ensues. Then, using classic laws about how metabolic rate varies across different species, they derive mathematical predictions about how sleep duration should vary with an animal\"s size. But which size is most relevant \u2212 brain size or body size? The key is that they are not proportional. If sleep is for repairing the brain, Savage and West derive one prediction; if it\"s for repairing the body, they derive a different prediction. When they finally confront their model with the available data, they infer that sleep is mainly required for repairing the brain, not the body. <b>So <\/b><b>much <\/b><b>for <\/b><b>beauty <\/b><b>sleep<\/b><b>.<\/b><b>\n<\/b><\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",

She said I needed to sleep because I had too much \"sleepy gas.\" It had been building up all day long, and so I needed to sleep to get rid of it. In fact, scientists observed a long time ago that if you keep a sheep awake continuously for several days and then inject some of its cerebrospinal fluid into another, well-rested sheep, that sheep will fall right asleep, presumably because some naturally-occurring sleep substance had reached a soporific level in the donor. But this line of research never quite solved the puzzle.

Such studies (now outlawed) could not pinpoint any specific culprits, such as particular organ failures. One striking observation, however, was that the rats ate much more than normal and yet wasted away. Their metabolism seemed to be wrecked.

Two physicists, Van Savage of Harvard Medical School and Geoff West of Santa Fe Institute, have analyzed how sleep varies across mammals of different species. Normally physiological time ticks slower for bigger animals. For example, elephants live much longer than mice and their hearts beat much slower. The interesting thing is that the lifetimes and pulse times of both elephants and mice scale in the same way with their body mass \u2212 in direct proportion to their mass raised to the 1\/4 power \u2212 with the curious implication that the hearts of mice and elephants will typically beat the same number of times in their lifetime.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">What is so strange about sleep in this regard is that it behaves differently from all other physiological times.

They note that cells produce destructive byproducts, such as free radicals, in the course of normal metabolism, and they hypothesize that sleep somehow helps repair the damage that ensues. Then, using classic laws about how metabolic rate varies across different species, they derive mathematical predictions about how sleep duration should vary with an animal\"s size. But which size is most relevant \u2212 brain size or body size? The key is that they are not proportional. If sleep is for repairing the brain, Savage and West derive one prediction; if it\"s for repairing the body, they derive a different prediction.

Our bodies and brains need food, water, and oxygen to stay alive and to replenish themselves, and if they didn\"t rid themselves of the byproducts of this metabolism, we\"d be awash in our own toxic waste. Likewise, sleep must be required for something important. We all spend decades in this strange state, immobilized, unconscious, and vulnerable. But what exactly does sleep do for us?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Parents tell their children they need to sleep because they\"re tired and require rest. But, of course, mere \u2018rest\u2019 is not good enough. Lying still for eight hours is no substitute for sleep. My own mother had a different theory. She said I needed to sleep because I had too much \"sleepy gas.\" It had been building up all day long, and so I needed to sleep to get rid of it. In fact, scientists observed a long time ago that if you keep a sheep awake continuously for several days and then inject some of its cerebrospinal fluid into another, well-rested sheep, that sheep will fall right asleep, presumably because some naturally-occurring sleep substance had reached a soporific level in the donor. But this line of research never quite solved the puzzle. Although a number of putative sleep substances have now been identified, we\"re not sure how they might work biochemically, or how sleep (as opposed to mere rest) might break them down.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Other sleep-deprivation studies done in the early 1980s took a more brutal approach. Rats were kept awake for weeks until they died from a lack of sleep. One then investigated the precise cause of death. Such studies (now outlawed) could not pinpoint any specific culprits, such as particular organ failures. One striking observation, however, was that the rats ate much more than normal and yet wasted away. Their metabolism seemed to be wrecked. So maybe sleep is required for energy regulation, in some unspecified way. Other popular theories are that sleep is required for tissue repair, or immune function, or for consolidating learning and memory.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The new development, and the cause for optimism, is an original approach to the problem that makes the first quantitative, testable predictions about the function of sleep. Two physicists, Van Savage of Harvard Medical School and Geoff West of Santa Fe Institute, have analyzed how sleep varies across mammals of different species. Normally physiological time ticks slower for bigger animals. For example, elephants live much longer than mice and their hearts beat much slower. The interesting thing is that the lifetimes and pulse times of both elephants and mice scale in the same way with their body mass \u2212 in direct proportion to their mass raised to the 1\/4 power \u2212 with the curious implication that the hearts of mice and elephants will typically beat the same number of times in their lifetime.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">What is so strange about sleep in this regard is that it behaves differently from all other physiological times. It\"s backward. Mice sleep longer than elephants, not shorter \u2212 about fourteen hours a day compared to four. Savage and West interpret this as evidence that sleep is related to cellular repair. They note that cells produce destructive byproducts, such as free radicals, in the course of normal metabolism, and they hypothesize that sleep somehow helps repair the damage that ensues. Then, using classic laws about how metabolic rate varies across different species, they derive mathematical predictions about how sleep duration should vary with an animal\"s size. But which size is most relevant \u2212 brain size or body size? The key is that they are not proportional. If sleep is for repairing the brain, Savage and West derive one prediction; if it\"s for repairing the body, they derive a different prediction. When they finally confront their model with the available data, they infer that sleep is mainly required for repairing the brain, not the body. <b>So <\/b><b>much <\/b><b>for <\/b><b>beauty <\/b><b>sleep<\/b><b>.<\/b><b>\n<\/b><\/font><\/p><\/span>\n",
