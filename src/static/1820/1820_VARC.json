The apparent \"genomic meltdown\" in the waning island population included pseudogenized olfactory genes, along with a loss of genes coding for urinary proteins related to elephant mate choice, and mutations in genes like FOXQ1 implicated in mammoth coat features, the researchers noted.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">\"These data bear the signature of genomic meltdown in small populations, consistent with nearly-neutral genome evolution,\" Rogers and Slatkin wrote in their <i>PLOS <\/i><i>Genetics <\/i>paper. \"They furthermore suggest large numbers of detrimental variants collecting in pre-extinction genomes, a warning for continued efforts to protect current endangered species with small population sizes.\"\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">For the new study, the pair set out to characterize genetic variants, deletions, point mutations, and more using existing genome sequence data for the Oimyakon mammoth and the Wrangel mammoth, sequenced to average depths of 11-fold and 17-fold coverage by the Swedish Museum of Natural History.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">When they compared these sequences to sequences from an Indian elephant and an African bush elephant reference genome, the researchers found significant differences between the two woolly mammoth genomes. The Wrangel Island mammoth genome contained more overall deletions, gene deletions, retrogene content, and stop codon-causing point mutations relative to the genome of the Oimyakon mammoth. ...\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">A rise in deletions was also detected in the genome of the Indian elephant, albeit to a lesser extent, reflecting declines in that animal\"s population, the researchers reported, pointing to the possibility of tapping genomic data for future conservation efforts in the Indian elephant and other species.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">\"Although compensatory mutations might conceivably correct for some detrimental mutations, with small effective population sizes, adaptation through both new mutation and standing variation may be severely limited,\" Rogers and Slatkin concluded. \"Thus, we might expect genomes affected by genomic meltdown to show lasting repercussions that will impede population recovery.\"\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1820"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu10":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'>What is the style of the passage?<b>\n<\/b><\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Narrative\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Descriptive\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Analytical\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Argumentative\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"a","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"3232","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"> <b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>10 <\/i><i>to <\/i><i>15<\/i><i>: <\/i>The passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.

Cancer, additionally, presents several unique hurdles. Cancer vaccines must overcome immune suppression exerted by the tumour, by previous therapy or by the effects of advanced age of the patient. If used for cancer prevention, vaccines must elicit effective long-term memory without the potential of causing autoimmunity. One needs to address the common and the unique challenges to cancer vaccines and the progress that has been made in meeting them. Considering how refractory cancer has been to standard therapy, efforts to achieve immune control of this disease are well justified. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image\/jpg;base64,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\" style=\"width: 133px; height: 155px;\" \/><\/i><\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Edward Jenner&rsquo;s landmark publication in 1798, that describes a vaccine against small pox, is considered to be the official beginning of the science of immunology. Immunology has since then made many contributions to scientific enterprise and to many different scientific disciplines, including genetics, molecular biology and cellular biology. The most important contribution of immunology to improving the quality of human life is the development of vaccines. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Thirty one infectious diseases are preventable through vaccination, at present. In spite of two centuries of vaccine development, however, there are still several parasitic, bacterial and viral diseases, such as Malaria, Dengue fever, Zika virus disease, Lyme disease, Chikungunya, Cytomegalovirus infection, Leishmaniasis, and several others that still don&quot;t have proper vaccines for their cure. Modern times have also brought new diseases such as AIDS and cancer. The successes from the past and an ever-increasing level in our understanding of basic immune mechanisms, and the ability to manipulate them, predict future victories. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In addition to taking on the challenge to design better vaccines against infectious diseases, immunologists are exploring the possibility of using vaccines against other ailments that involve the immune system. Most notable efforts are directed to developing vaccines for cancer and certain autoimmune diseases. Vaccines that are designed to prepare the immune system for encounter with either infectious pathogens or with cancer or mediators of autoimmunity, all face certain common challenges. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Traditionally, successful vaccines have consisted of live attenuated pathogens. Although effective at the population level, these vaccines have a small but significant risk of activation that can cause disease or other harmful side effects. On the basis of the successes of attenuated pathogen vaccines and owing to the initial lack of defined tumour antigens, the first cancer vaccines were composed of whole tumour cells that were previously irradiated or otherwise inactivated. In mouse models, this immunization strategy was successful, producing tumour specific immune responses and rejection of a tumour challenge. These early vaccines used either tumour cell lines that had accumulated many mutations through numerous passages in vivo or in vitro and were, therefore, highly immunogenic, or carcinogenic-induced tumours with unique mutations that function as highly stimulatory antigens. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Just as vaccines that are based on whole pathogens are associated with risks of reactivation and development of disease, whole tumour cell vaccines present significant health risks. The most serious is the potential for causing autoimmunity. Immature dendritic cells (DCs) that reside in tissues take up and process dying cells and self antigens, but in the absence of strong activating signals, such as those given by pathogens, no immune response to these antigens is generated. To elicit strong immunity, the tumour-cell vaccine must include substances that activate DCs.

In mouse models, this immunization strategy was successful, producing tumour specific immune responses and rejection of a tumour challenge.

Although effective at the population level, these vaccines have a small but significant risk of activation that can cause disease or other harmful side effects. On the basis of the successes of attenuated pathogen vaccines and owing to the initial lack of defined tumour antigens, the first cancer vaccines were composed of whole tumour cells that were previously irradiated or otherwise inactivated. In mouse models, this immunization strategy was successful, producing tumour specific immune responses and rejection of a tumour challenge. These early vaccines used either tumour cell lines that had accumulated many mutations through numerous passages in vivo or in vitro and were, therefore, highly immunogenic, or carcinogenic-induced tumours with unique mutations that function as highly stimulatory antigens. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Just as vaccines that are based on whole pathogens are associated with risks of reactivation and development of disease, whole tumour cell vaccines present significant health risks. The most serious is the potential for causing autoimmunity. Immature dendritic cells (DCs) that reside in tissues take up and process dying cells and self antigens, but in the absence of strong activating signals, such as those given by pathogens, no immune response to these antigens is generated. To elicit strong immunity, the tumour-cell vaccine must include substances that activate DCs. In the case of whole tumour cells, however, it should be expected that in addition to presenting tumour-specific antigens, activated DCs would prime immunity to many other antigens (autoantigens) that are otherwise subject to peripheral tolerance.

Considering how refractory cancer has been to standard therapy, efforts to achieve immune control of this disease are well justified. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"data:image\/jpg;base64,R0lGODlhhQCbAPcAAP\/\/\/93d3QAAAEdHR6enpyMjI8PDw2lpaYmJiQAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACwAAAAAhQCbAAAI\/wABCBxIsKDBgwgTKlzIsKHDhxAjSpxIsaLFixgzatzIsaPHjyBDihxJsqTJkyhTqlzJsqXLlzBjypxJs+bLAAJyChiQkAABkTwBFAjg0EDQgQcQ2DQ6sIABhENDIlAq1KJTm1MHDviJM6fAAjkJHBAo4KeBAgAQ5BwrcEBYgVPBUoUb1qjaoF0FGBzwlEBOtUTdlhWY92lKvoT1AhhMgCdTpo1\/HvCpeCuAA0EFBNa8uGBUBAWUImZ89GsAA4oLoMVMlujVsyrB6iSKAK9eBGOZblWKtsDPtAdwEgVgmTNOgscvU3VaOzFytJbTDhDelqtA2CgDoB2oWbDOy1yHTv9GQABB3rV+dZYNELQxQaZCh+v17nUgU87A0+skcJ7tSbEEORVdU8OFZoABoAGQ3EDuEQRgWnNB+NV1PA1YUFb4bdWgVr8llRJ5DKKF21dKKbaYYwWw9ZpmySU4WVuGCfQifCOOKFSEiPkGgF8GtAidUqj9dhJ9Jgr2W32hAYDacHkxmFNQUXVG0AFlZQVeW28FSBRqAlApUHq2CVCAhTaVaeaZaKap5ppstunmm3DGKeecdNZp55145qlnRAP4t5CFPilZGkcAZhXcmwaw1hB+pu0YIUcgEradm0NNGpcAVKmFqYlCeTUZWL9p6qeCoQmA4FpaoUrcU5o9+SB2Zpb\/Fx+WROlFwHY7vQflUNrtWJmQSmLqa3XAfcUqqRLCh9iZ2y1rnF5XXeanjZzBpmOxAzUnVKhjDSdUj2gBaFmviaJp5YvsfTmdiR4iZVZ7wanX5ZRcyTsWfTuOlVWU0Hpbpr35wmWeidE2Kit4CxoUVcI7BgUbiHz1SuKoNUUq6JWrLvYUYAQp9uK3IC\/ZcVNPLXnrVxUeCx9xjC416YT8frnWy4v1S1Zi9dl3VJNYdsmTXuTmKu2eNkVJdExUAnv00kw37fTTUEct9dRUV2311Vg7LVvOBw3a0aEfewSlvyWx+2i2Z28k8XQfWanSyjbKtnFYHkPZ43d0zUuqWi93\/\/Uzl6kOpiuVfOVkmGBKaepTt7NVZzikc13Vp4KpuRaYYz\/\/5J5fxPqlVNjJjimhoi2D9lOuAJL+1Gclao4rWitnROV+wZKc3FA+rYagbdvCNVa7FlrWYFLUEQdsu5yJtSDxlSHon2bYbZiR0bvJe2BQfPHUG8vqnTcv24v5G9XHfOmXZaPwJbVhUvANNaBmB7ebkcQyTjXqueJCDCzDUtKPLHHyaRhCJPag8h2FOUrpVXRgQ74YYaRciTnNdljzsQNcRTW+I1HIoAcvXd1MSWjxkQcxBjTOUFBz+srMT2K2EU3pxDCiktFgEnSjwP2GZ\/h7z07g8yAwXWg5W2rPk9pkWB6qGOl\/scuaEpfIxCY68YlQjKIUp0jFKlrxili8yOQaAqh3ceRQeEqU1xDSsqgcbH40q1Ol0CaXvKklQJ66leBiWBD9BG5gQrOTrKLkllrtCFelaR+vwvUr5ChmRAdgXADcZqdmGeZZIBtatthSrd5wCzmTZBiZ5pTDdDVseRGaEby85yfz+WRQRqsTwB40lQUVbFbx4w+nCoIfp0jPf3SyGFMaqLG0tMxjv7lgyX45t9NU5gBJlBOsYBZAX3WJZl5hIc8ctBbOxBA1Y8yiNrfJzW5685vgDP+nOMdJznIihD7ZtBXFCjI2iiRTIS0rUyoPki6LHcRKaXzIGRmyzDLh0pdi+tK9noI4gijOLkKbppMCCh5Q5W1SiONJXogyI2uukyQPss8EP3c6AfaSQGlJ0mg0NygTjkU1ASDXRoeGmtb9cXRsm6dJXJiTlCJFNOCinNeS0y7m8I4gfeTOlkJ4U1eW53mLFA0yIaiSZWVLPcfKqF+A1b4AEukgueKhvqC6IQEJCX6TEUuiHIiSWS6IRTwhD3Zih08KGQ8qhsEdVSZz1gA06DgLhB1ryJNNknhyINTxkrjutjE\/iTKDccMR4zDmlMDqBTVtEZEKQaiva6kko0\/tkl7iXqQYO06pSnP9zRFp+RYWispja2HLaHGysXya87Wwja1sZ0vb2tr2trjNrW53y9ve+va3wA2ucIdL3OIa97jITa5yl8vc5k6ES+pJm3oS4j11YmwvUWOkZ0LlWszCRWk\/jBroaNkxsskIvBFr1l8ACt6jyRQp8dwLWTuzy8yszrxH+2dBuDRf7sgrpSIaWFFnWaf0pJGpCsFJe\/+ZulPe9J1H0y5gX2ajOlIMRLg7IILSdjSnKmwugivIeFfVq8DyZMRLM1F8t2YWmhHpZxdzZlCS5twa2\/jGOM6xjnfMYz0FBAA7\" style=\"width: 133px; height: 155px;\" \/><\/i><\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Edward Jenner&rsquo;s landmark publication in 1798, that describes a vaccine against small pox, is considered to be the official beginning of the science of immunology. Immunology has since then made many contributions to scientific enterprise and to many different scientific disciplines, including genetics, molecular biology and cellular biology. The most important contribution of immunology to improving the quality of human life is the development of vaccines. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Thirty one infectious diseases are preventable through vaccination, at present. In spite of two centuries of vaccine development, however, there are still several parasitic, bacterial and viral diseases, such as Malaria, Dengue fever, Zika virus disease, Lyme disease, Chikungunya, Cytomegalovirus infection, Leishmaniasis, and several others that still don&quot;t have proper vaccines for their cure. Modern times have also brought new diseases such as AIDS and cancer. The successes from the past and an ever-increasing level in our understanding of basic immune mechanisms, and the ability to manipulate them, predict future victories. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">In addition to taking on the challenge to design better vaccines against infectious diseases, immunologists are exploring the possibility of using vaccines against other ailments that involve the immune system. Most notable efforts are directed to developing vaccines for cancer and certain autoimmune diseases. Vaccines that are designed to prepare the immune system for encounter with either infectious pathogens or with cancer or mediators of autoimmunity, all face certain common challenges. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Traditionally, successful vaccines have consisted of live attenuated pathogens. Although effective at the population level, these vaccines have a small but significant risk of activation that can cause disease or other harmful side effects. On the basis of the successes of attenuated pathogen vaccines and owing to the initial lack of defined tumour antigens, the first cancer vaccines were composed of whole tumour cells that were previously irradiated or otherwise inactivated. In mouse models, this immunization strategy was successful, producing tumour specific immune responses and rejection of a tumour challenge. These early vaccines used either tumour cell lines that had accumulated many mutations through numerous passages in vivo or in vitro and were, therefore, highly immunogenic, or carcinogenic-induced tumours with unique mutations that function as highly stimulatory antigens. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Just as vaccines that are based on whole pathogens are associated with risks of reactivation and development of disease, whole tumour cell vaccines present significant health risks. The most serious is the potential for causing autoimmunity. Immature dendritic cells (DCs) that reside in tissues take up and process dying cells and self antigens, but in the absence of strong activating signals, such as those given by pathogens, no immune response to these antigens is generated. To elicit strong immunity, the tumour-cell vaccine must include substances that activate DCs. In the case of whole tumour cells, however, it should be expected that in addition to presenting tumour-specific antigens, activated DCs would prime immunity to many other antigens (autoantigens) that are otherwise subject to peripheral tolerance. This is not a hypothetical case &ndash; evidence for auto-immune reactions following vaccination has accumulated from work in animal models especially mouse models, as well as clinical trials. <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1820-1"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu22":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'>Which of the following can be understood from the boldfaced portions of the passage?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Postcolonial studies advocate the renewal of Eastern cultures and a rejection of Western influence over them.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Internalizing colonial assumptions about the inferiority of the conquered peoples and constructing the Orient through the lens of Europeans form the substratum of postcolonial studies. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Postcolonial studies highlight the economic exploitation of native people and analyze the western ways of depicting the Eastern world. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Postcolonial studies should question western conceptions of the east and assimilate the Eastern sentiment.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"d","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"3234","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"> <b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>22 <\/i><i>to <\/i><i>24<\/i><i>: <\/i>The passage given below is followed by a set of three questions.

Rejection of Orientalist thinking does not entail a denial of the differences between \"the West\" and \"the Orient\", but rather an evaluation of such differences in a  critical and objective fashion. \"The Orient\" cannot be studied in a non-Orientalist manner; rather, the scholar is obliged to study more focussed and smaller culturally consistent regions. <b>The <\/b><b>person <\/b><b>who <\/b><b>has <\/b><b>until <\/b><b>now <\/b><b>been <\/b><b>known <\/b><b>as <\/b><b>\"the <\/b><b>Oriental\" <\/b><b>must <\/b><b>be <\/b><b>given <\/b><b>a <\/b><b>voice<\/b><b>. <\/b><b>Scholarship <\/b><b>from <\/b><b>afar <\/b><b>and <\/b><b>second<\/b><b>-<\/b><b>hand <\/b><b>representation <\/b><b>must <\/b><b>take <\/b><b>a <\/b><b>back <\/b><b>seat <\/b><b>to <\/b><b>narrative <\/b><b>and <\/b><b>self<\/b><b>-<\/b><b>representation <\/b><b>on <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>part <\/b><b>of <\/b><b>the <\/b><b>\"Oriental\"<\/b><b>.<\/b><b>\n<\/b><\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1820"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu25":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>25 <\/i><i>to <\/i><i>27<\/i><i>: <\/i>Five sentences related to a topic are given below.

You&#39;ll hear many men and women saying, &ldquo;If you want to lose weight you have to give up those in-between snacks. They are the worst.&rdquo; We don&#39;t know exactly where that idea of &lsquo;three meals a day is best&rsquo; comes from, but it wasn&#39;t the way our ancestors ate. If you look at how humans evolved, you&#39;ll see that our long-lost relatives were &lsquo;frequent feeders&rsquo;, not bingers. In fact, it&#39;s revealing to take a look at the animal kingdom and notice the relationship between the way animals consume their meals and their body &lsquo;type&rsquo; and &lsquo;shape&rsquo;. At one end of the spectrum are animals such as bears, which store vast amounts of fat in wide, round bodies, for hibernation periods when they may go for weeks without food. These animals are &lsquo;bingers&rsquo; and carry lots of body fat. At the other end of the spectrum are the &lsquo;frequent feeders&rsquo;. The lean, mean, munching machines &ndash; horses, elk, deer &ndash; spend all day nibbling on small bits of vegetation &ndash; little portions, all day. They have whippet-lean limbs and taut, muscular bodies. I can&rsquo;t say I have ever wanted to be a horse, but the rippled, tight and frequently filled part sounds fab!<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Animals are of different types: hedgehogs and foxes. Those that go without eating for months would have stored food in their huge fat bodies and those that eat at regular intervals have lean bodies with low body fat. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The relationship between eating habits and body structure of animals can be explained by the fact that those eating large amounts infrequently (bingers) have huge fat bodies whereas those eating less but regularly (grazers) have lean bodies. Starving may not help one lose body fat. Frequent feeding in required quantities can help a human being achieve a desired taut, muscular and lean physique. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Animals are of two types. Bingers like bears load up on large amounts of food at one meal and then go for long periods without eating. They have huge body fat storage compartments. Frequent feeders like horses eat almost constantly but in far lesser amounts. Relatively speaking, they have very low body fat and lots of lean muscle. <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n\t<\/li>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Animals are of different types; primarily bingers and grazers. It is good to be a grazer as it helps one lose body fat.

For India, the reasoning is simple: if I wish to strengthen friendship with your brother, it makes sense that I be friends with you. It&rsquo;s almost inevitable and, from India&rsquo;s perspective, highly desirable, to build a solid foundation of trust and shared interests with Israel. Since India and Israel established diplomatic relations in 1992, the two countries have inexorably moved closer &ndash; a radical shift from India&rsquo;s earlier stance. Since this shift, trade relations between India and Israel have skyrocketed. Prior to that time, the country was an active supporter of Palestinian cause and was one of the first non-Muslim and non-Arab nations to support Yasir Arafat &ndash; at a time, when Israel, the United States and some other Western nations considered his Palestine Liberation Organization to be a terrorist outfit. In the United Nations, India supported virtually every motion that asked Israel to vacate Palestine and other Arab territories it had captured during the wars in 1948, 1967 and 1973.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<ol>\r\n\t<li style=\"vertical-align:middle; padding-bottom:10px;list-style-type:decimal;\">\r\n\t\t<p style=\"vertical-align:text-top; display:inline-block;\">\r\n\t\t\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">India aspires to become like Israel, which owns the world&rsquo;s most sophisticated weapons.
