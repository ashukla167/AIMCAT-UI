Choose the best answer to each question.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9999999\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>R<\/b>eferendums are supposed to get citizens engaged in politics and make governments responsive. If they worked, Europeans ought to be feeling particularly satisfied with their democracies. For referendums are on the rise\u2026\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Despite this direct democracy, Europeans are alienated from politics and furious with their governments. Referendum-mania has not slowed the rise of populist, Eurosceptic parties which attack the establishment as corrupt and out of touch. Plebiscites meant to settle thorny issues instead often aggravate them: after Scotland\u2019s independence referendum failed in 2014, membership of the Scottish National Party quadrupled, suggesting another confrontation is coming.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Referendums, it turns out, are a tricky instrument. They can bring the alienated back into politics, especially where the issues being voted on are local and clear. On rare occasions they can settle once-in-a-generation national questions, such as whether a country should be part of a larger union. But, much of the time, plebiscites lead to bad politics and bad policy.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The most problematic are those on propositions that voters do not understand or subjects which are beyond governments\u2019 control. In 2015 Alexis Tsipras, prime minister of Greece, called a referendum on the bail-out offered by his country\u2019s creditors. His citizens - many of whom did not realise that refusal meant default - voted no. Mr Tsipras had to take the deal anyway, exacerbating the public\u2019s cynicism about politics.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Plebiscites that ask a country\u2019s voters what they think of a policy set by other countries often disappoint. The Dutch rejected the EU-Ukraine agreement, but may be stuck with much of it unless the EU\u2019s other 27 members agree to changes. Switzerland does domestic referendums well, but is in hot water over one that restricts immigration from the EU.

Called FreeFAB, the system uses specialised wax to print ultra-precise moulds that, in turn, are used to cast concrete panels which are being installed in passenger tunnels as part of Crossrail, Europe\u2019s biggest construction firm. Run by Laing O\u2019Rourke, a construction firm, FreeFAB is the first 3D-printing technology used in a big commercial building project. Show offices have been printed in Dubai and China, but are, for now, just concepts. The problem is that printed concrete is currently produced in layers, which are fused together to make a thicker panel. But the boundaries between the layers introduce weaknesses that make the panels unsuitable for real buildings.

Invented by James Gardiner, an Australian architect, it has big advantages over traditional mould-making techniques. It creates far less waste. Ordinary moulds are made from wood and polystyrene, and can only be used to produce a single shape. Once they are finished with, they are scrapped and sent to landfill. FreeFAB\u2019s wax can be melted down and poured back into the tank, ready to be re-extruded into a new form.

FreeFAB can print one in three hours. That speed makes it possible to meet the design and cost demands of more complicated buildings. Doing so with traditional methods would be expensive. And because the concrete itself is not being printed, the panels are just as strong as the ones made in the traditional way.

Called FreeFAB, the system uses specialised wax to print ultra-precise moulds that, in turn, are used to cast concrete panels which are being installed in passenger tunnels as part of Crossrail, Europe\u2019s biggest construction firm. Run by Laing O\u2019Rourke, a construction firm, FreeFAB is the first 3D-printing technology used in a big commercial building project. Show offices have been printed in Dubai and China, but are, for now, just concepts. The problem is that printed concrete is currently produced in layers, which are fused together to make a thicker panel. But the boundaries between the layers introduce weaknesses that make the panels unsuitable for real buildings. These things can peel apart.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">FreeFAB gets around that problem by printing moulds rather than trying to print structural material directly. Invented by James Gardiner, an Australian architect, it has big advantages over traditional mould-making techniques. It creates far less waste. Ordinary moulds are made from wood and polystyrene, and can only be used to produce a single shape. Once they are finished with, they are scrapped and sent to landfill. FreeFAB\u2019s wax can be melted down and poured back into the tank, ready to be re-extruded into a new form. It took Dr Gardiner three years to find a wax which could be printed, milled and recycled.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The system also makes it cheaper to make even complicated moulds.

FreeFAB can print one in three hours. That speed makes it possible to meet the design and cost demands of more complicated buildings. Doing so with traditional methods would be expensive. And because the concrete itself is not being printed, the panels are just as strong as the ones made in the traditional way.

Dr Block makes floors that have the flowing, veined look of biological membranes and are just a few centimetres thick. Instead of building floors that rely on steel reinforcement to hold them up, Dr Block builds them under compression, so that each bit of the floor holds up the rest in a shallow vault. Each is bespoke, designed by a computer to efficiently deal with the specific loads it must bear.

At the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2016, Dr Block constructed a 15-metre vaulted \u201ctent\u201d out of 399 blocks of cunningly shaped limestone, each precisely milled to match the pattern of forces necessary to hold the vault up. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Dr Block\u2019s group will also make the floors for a new part of the building called HiLo.

Each is bespoke, designed by a computer to efficiently deal with the specific loads it must bear. This allows him to build much thinner structures out of materials much weaker than reinforced concrete.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Dr Block calculates that his new, thinner floors would need only about a third as much material as a typical floor slab. Their thinness allows him to claw back enough vertical space to fit three floors into the space that would be taken by two floors built in the standard way. At the Venice Architecture Biennale in 2016, Dr Block constructed a 15-metre vaulted \u201ctent\u201d out of 399 blocks of cunningly shaped limestone, each precisely milled to match the pattern of forces necessary to hold the vault up. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Dr Block\u2019s group will also make the floors for a new part of the building called HiLo. The main bottleneck is that it is expensive and slow to mill all the parts from blocks of stone, or to build traditional moulds for each individual component. So Drs Block and Gardiner are planning to work together on HiLo, using FreeFAB to print moulds that will produce segments of the floors. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Dr Gardiner also dreams about using FreeFAB to build thin bridges that span rivers in a single bound. For now, that is a project for the future. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1809"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu23":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">According to the passage, all of the following statements regarding Stalin are true EXCEPT? <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Stalin executed nearly a million Russians.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>When it comes to the use of the word \u201cgenocide\u201d, public opinion has been kinder to Stalin than to Hitler.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Community complicity has prompted the blind eye towards Stalin's pogroms.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Stalin vetoed any definition of genocide that might incriminate him.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","CORRECT_ANSWER":"d","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"4081","EASSY_DETAILS":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>3<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>2<\/i><i>8<\/i><i>:<\/i><b> <\/b>The passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.
