That&#39;s the conclusion that scientists are reaching after a 2014 discovery planted the seed of the idea. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">But first, let&#39;s get a refresher on the layers of the earth. The part of the planet we deal with most of the time is the crust, the uppermost layer that&#39;s about 30 miles thick at its biggest. Beneath that is the mantle, which is itself made of three different sub-layers: the upper mantle, the transition zone, and the lower mantle. Together, they&#39;re about 1,800 miles thick, and they make up about 84 percent of the planet&#39;s volume. Down beneath the mantle is the core, but it&#39;s in the mantle that you&#39;ll find our secret sixth ocean. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">So, how&#39;d they find the ocean? The clue came in the form of a brown diamond that formed about 400 miles (644 kilometers) beneath the crust. That&#39;s not where they found it, though. Sometime in the past, volcanic forces had pushed the diamond to the surface, where a team discovered it in Mato Grosso, Brazil. Within that diamond, they found another mineral, ringwoodite, which is notable for its tendency to absorb surrounding water. The chunk of ringwoodite was comprised about 1.5 percent water. That particular chunk of stone won&#39;t quench your thirst, but it suggests that wherever it came from, there&#39;s a whole lot more to be found. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">One thing we should probably make clear: just because there is so much water underground, that doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s necessarily sloshing around like it does here on the surface. Instead, much of it may be trapped in ringwoodite like the chunk that researchers found. But we do know exactly where in the mantle it&#39;s located. It&#39;s widely accepted that the upper and lower mantles are bone-dry, but the wateriness of the transition zone has been the subject of some debate.

In 1945 unconditional surrender forced Germany, or what was left of its western part, into a &lsquo;second round of capitalist transformation&rsquo; of the sort no other European country has ever had to undergo. Germany&rsquo;s bout was a violent - sharp and short - push forward into social and economic &lsquo;modernity&rsquo;, driving it for ever from the halfway house of Weimar, in a painful dismantling of structures of political domination and social solidarity, feudal fetters which had held back the country&rsquo;s capitalist progress and which, in locally different manifestations, continue to block capitalist rationalisation in many other European countries. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">First among the events that put West Germany on the path to what it would later become was the arrival of ten million refugees and expellees from the East, who made up roughly one in five inhabitants of a devastated territory less than half the size of the pre-war Reich. While some of them remained isolated, depressed and poor for the rest of their lives, others had brought with them as their only possession a determination to fit in and succeed in what was for them in many ways a foreign country. Their arrival disrupted forever, the fabric of what had been until then a largely traditional society divided between urban and rural, Catholic and Protestant, left and right. Centuries-old parochial ways of life and socio-cultural milieu were broken up, often in the face of adamant resistance. But, ultimately, the skills and hard work the newcomers contributed to their new homeland forced the locals to give them a chance to establish themselves. As a result, West Germany became a uniquely competitive and meritocratic society. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">This was far from all, the two forces that had between them worn down the Weimar Republic - the eastern aristocracy (the Junkers whom Max Weber had identified as the Reich&rsquo;s main roadblock to capitalist modernity) and the Communist opposition - had disappeared. Both wings, reactionary and potentially progressive, of one time resistance to capital were thus eliminated, leaving only the Social Democrats (SPD) and Christian Democrats (CDU) in the middle. The CDU, a descendant of the Catholic Zentrumspartei of the Weimar period, appealed to Christians irrespective of denomination, in keeping with the postwar break-up of homogeneous local confessional communities. Add to this the disappearance of the Nazis as an organised political force and the incarceration of Germany&rsquo;s industrial tycoons by the Allies (albeit soon to be released to help with the Korean War), and the result was a vastly simplified political landscape and an economic geography shorn of the parasitic manorialism of Prussia, now dominated instead by what would become the highly productive dualism of a small-firm economy in the south, south-west and Rhineland, and the huge industrial complexes in the Ruhr. While the industrialists were in custody, the British had introduced robust rights for unions and workers&rsquo; participation in management, particularly of coal and steel companies. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Unconditional surrender and the carving up of the Reich helped the German economy in other ways too. German industry had always been dependent on foreign markets for sale of its manufactured goods and for the raw materials it needed. Fear of being denied access to these markets, especially by the British, was an old German nightmare, which the Nazis tried to end through imperial conquest and autarky. The small, wholly defeated, semi-sovereign West Germany did not have such options. In the event, integration into the American-led post-Bretton Woods free-trade regime, and later into the EEC, offered a vastly superior alternative, not least because under the regime&rsquo;s fixed exchange rates the new West German currency became increasingly undervalued over time. In the 1950s and 1960s, this laid the foundation for a uniquely strong, heavily export-dependent, quality-driven industrial sector, which, continuing older traditions, became the centre of gravity of the West German and later the German political economy. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1914_5"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu16":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Which of the following summarizes the feature(s) of the NOTCH2NLs genes as can be inferred from Dr Haussler's initial discovery mentioned in the passage?\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>The NOTCH2NLs genes, implicated in embryonic development and the emergence of big brains in humans, are inactive in macaques but are active in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas.
