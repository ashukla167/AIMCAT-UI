He wrote that the characters in The Iliad don't look inward and they take no independent initiative. They only do what is suggested by the gods. When something needs to happen, a god appears and speaks. Without these voices, the heroes would stand frozen on the beaches of Troy, like puppets. The combination of instinct and voices - the bicameral mind - would have allowed humans to manage for quite some time, as long as their societies were rigidly hierarchical. But 3,000 years ago, in the breakdown of the bicameral mind, bits of the conscious mind would have come to awareness, as the voices mostly died away. That led to a more flexible way of coping with the decisions of everyday life - one better suited to the chaos that ensued when the gods went silent. By The Odyssey, the characters are capable of something like interior thought. The modern mind, with its internal narrative and longing for direction from a higher power, appears.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Julian Jaynes was of the view that the characters of the Illiad are conscious even though they are puppets of the gods while the characters of the Odyssey were capable of introspection and taking decisions on their own.
