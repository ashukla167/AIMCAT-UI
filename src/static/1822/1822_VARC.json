Only last year the World Health Organisation told us that, globally, \u201cbabies born in 2015 [could] expect to live to 71.4 years\u201d, so that\u2019s quite a jump we see here.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">I dread to think what next year\u2019s estimate will be, because life in your 90s is not always much fun. My mother lived to 98. It was difficult and frustrating for her from 90 to 95, losing her independence, and hellish after her stroke in her mid-90s \u2013 by which time she was longing to die, often begging me and the hospital consultants to finish her off. \u201cWe can\u2019t help you with that, I\u2019m afraid,\u201d said one consultant, and I had to look the other way and have a little cry.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">But my mother\u2019s despair was understandable. Because, as the WHO pointed out last year, that \u201chealthy life expectancy falls a good deal short of life expectancy\u201d. And that\u2019s the big problem. It would be lovely to live into your 90s if you were fit and healthy, could live free of discomfort, and carry on doing the things you loved \u2013 dancing, cooking, chatting, getting about \u2013 but you usually can\u2019t.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Life is not much fun if, like my mother and her peers, you can barely move or talk, everything hurts, you\u2019re terrified of incontinence and dementia, you feel like a useless burden, and most of your friends are dead. Or if they\u2019re still around, you can\u2019t get to see them. Who\u2019s going to take you to meet your remaining old chums and look after you?...\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">I would laugh if it wasn\u2019t so serious. In the UK, our health and social care setups are going down the pan already. What state are they going to be in after 2030? I imagine 70- and 80-year-old children tottering around caring for their ancient parents. Unless they\u2019re still working, because who can afford to be retired for 25-30 years?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">I am frightened of death, but becoming almost more frightened of living to a very old age in this country. But perhaps I won\u2019t have to. There are always caveats to these reports: climate change, natural disasters, new and uncontrollable diseases or gigantic wars may wipe out millions of us. I don\u2019t like to sound too dismal, but I no longer know which is the worse option.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1822"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu7":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'>The practice of alchemy or something alike can be traced back to which of the following countries\/ civilizations?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Greece\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Babylon\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Egypt\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>India\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"b","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"2642","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"> <b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>7 <\/i><i>to <\/i><i>12<\/i><i>: <\/i>The passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.

The most well-known aim of alchemy was to find a technique through which the alchemist could transmute base metals like lead into gold. For some alchemists \u201cthe great work\u201d was less about the prosaic transformation of materials than about a higher transformation of one\u2019s soul: to leave baser human foibles behind for spiritual enlightenment. The vehicle by which either transmutation would occur was the production of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. Small portions of this material added to lead were said to change it into gold.

The practice of something akin to alchemy can be traced back to ancient Babylon. ... The Greek mania for simplifying the universe so it could be better understood led to the creation of the four elements concept. The Greeks visualized the world around a diagram listing air, fire, earth, and water as the four basic building blocks of the universe. The entire universe, they believed, was made up of combinations of these four elements and their corresponding conditions (hot, dry, cold, and wet). The logic behind this arrangement suggested that, if all matter was made of these four simple elements, it would be relatively easy to change one bit of matter into another by simply re-arranging the recipe by which they were combined. With that, the popular concept of alchemy was born.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Two of the most famous Islamic alchemists were Al Jabir ibn Hayyan (722-815) and Al Razi (866-925). Jabir, known to his later Christian admirers as Geber, created a number of alchemical apparatus \u2013 such as the distillation flask, alembic, and test tubes \u2013 that became standard equipment in any alchemical laboratory. ...\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The golden age of alchemy was from the late Medieval through renaissance periods of European history. Renaissance magi came to believe that the originator of alchemy was Hermes Trismigistus (thrice great Hermes), a composite of Greco-Roman deities. As a result, an entire body of knowledge, not all of which was alchemical, was developed based upon the writings attributed to this character and called the <i>Hermetica<\/i>. The first alchemical book to reach Europe was a translation by Englishman Robert of Chester called <i>The <\/i><i>Book <\/i><i>of <\/i><i>the <\/i><i>Composition <\/i><i>of <\/i><i>Alchemy<\/i><i>. <\/i><i>... <\/i>Most modern scientific chemical processes can find their origins in alchemical research.

It is persuasively argued by historians that alchemical research helped pave the way for later understandings of the universe and was a pivotal intellectual part of the Scientific Revolution. ...

The most well-known aim of alchemy was to find a technique through which the alchemist could transmute base metals like lead into gold. For some alchemists \u201cthe great work\u201d was less about the prosaic transformation of materials than about a higher transformation of one\u2019s soul: to leave baser human foibles behind for spiritual enlightenment. The vehicle by which either transmutation would occur was the production of the Philosopher\u2019s Stone. Small portions of this material added to lead were said to change it into gold.

The practice of something akin to alchemy can be traced back to ancient Babylon. ... The Greek mania for simplifying the universe so it could be better understood led to the creation of the four elements concept. The Greeks visualized the world around a diagram listing air, fire, earth, and water as the four basic building blocks of the universe. The entire universe, they believed, was made up of combinations of these four elements and their corresponding conditions (hot, dry, cold, and wet). The logic behind this arrangement suggested that, if all matter was made of these four simple elements, it would be relatively easy to change one bit of matter into another by simply re-arranging the recipe by which they were combined. With that, the popular concept of alchemy was born.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Two of the most famous Islamic alchemists were Al Jabir ibn Hayyan (722-815) and Al Razi (866-925).

As a result, an entire body of knowledge, not all of which was alchemical, was developed based upon the writings attributed to this character and called the <i>Hermetica<\/i>.

You feel entirely in his presence, hanging on his every word, following the implications of his ideas as they travel from his experience to yours.

And, more important, that he knows you. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Recounting his visits to the South, where he reported on the civil rights movement and the murderous white response to it, Baldwin modestly described himself as a witness, a watchful presence on the sidelines of tragedy and heroism; an outsider by virtue of his Northern origins and his alienation from the Christianity of his childhood. But he was also a prophet, able to see the truths revealed by the contingent, complicated actions of ordinary people on both sides of the conflict. This is not to say that he transcended the struggle or detached himself from it. He demonstrated that writing and thinking clearly are manifestations of commitment, and that a ruthless critical spirit is necessary for moral and political action.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">\u201cI Am Not Your Negro\u201d is a thrilling introduction to his work, a remedial course in American history, and an advanced seminar in racial politics \u2013 a concise, roughly 90-minute movie with the scope and impact of a 10-hour mini-series or a literary doorstop. ... \u201cI can\u2019t be a pessimist because I\u2019m alive,\u201d Baldwin had said. \u201cI\u2019m forced to be an optimist.\u201d\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1822"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu19":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'>Which of the following choices can complete the last paragraph of the passage?\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Therefore, it is bad to consider ourselves superior to others.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT2":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>This is the reason that political discord, social conflict, and even terrorism in our country is on the rise.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Thus, the fact that we tend to believe that we are above the moral average could ironically makes us less so.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'>Thus, a feeling of moral superiority will lead to people following lenient ethical codes.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","CORRECT_ANSWER":"c","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"2644","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"> <b>DIRECTIONS <\/b><i>for <\/i><i>questions <\/i><i>19 <\/i><i>to <\/i><i>24<\/i><i>: <\/i>The passage given below is followed by a set of six questions.

This self-enhancement effect is most profound for moral characteristics. While we generally cast ourselves in a positive light relative to our peers, we believe that we are more moral than others. This self-righteousness is destructive because it reduces our willingness to cooperate or compromise, creates distance between ourselves and others, and can lead to intolerance or even violence. ...\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Ben Tappin and Ryan McKay wondered why people strongly believe they are moral, yet simultaneously regard the average person as significantly less so. They conducted a study in which participants considered 30 character traits, including traits associated with morality (e.g., sincerity), sociability (e.g., warmth), and agency (e.g., competence). Participants rated the extent to which each trait described themselves, described the average person, and was socially desirable. They worked out how irrational it was for people to think of themselves as better than average in each of these categories. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">How did they determine how rational people were being? Well, some degree of self-enhancement is actually rational. When we make judgments about ourselves and others, we have far more information about our own actions and behaviors than we do about the average person and we are more cautious in our evaluations of others relative to ourselves.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">The key to estimating the rational component of self-enhancement is understanding how an individual might infer the characteristics of others. To do this, Tappin and McKay adapted the Social Projection Index (SPI). This measure recognizes that statistically, most people are in the majority most of the time, so to make accurate judgments about others we should, to some extent, project what we know about ourselves. Of course the extent of that projection will vary: it depends on how unusual a person truly is. People are rational when they accurately perceive how similar they are to the average person, and make use of that. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">To illustrate, consider the following example. Let\u2019s say Jane\u2019s ratings of herself are very similar to the average of the self-ratings made by others. She is fairly typical. In her case, it would be rational for her to assume that others have similar ratings to her own. And, conversely, it would be irrational for her to assume that she is better than others. Let\u2019s say that Jack, on the other hand, rates himself in ways that are atypical of the average of the self-ratings made by others. He is objectively unusual. In his case, it would be more rational for him to assume that he is better than others in some way.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Of course one challenge in making rational self-evaluations is knowing how typical (or atypical) you truly are. Tappin and McKay were able to measure individuals\u2019 typicality more precisely using the responses from their experiment. First, they calculated the profile of the \u201ctypical Joe\u201d by averaging the self-evaluation ratings for all participants. Then, for each participant, they evaluated the extent to which individual self-ratings aligned with those of the \u201ctypical Joe,\u201d a measure known as the \u201ccoefficient of similarity.\u201d Those with a high coefficient of similarity (like Jane) would be expected to have similar ratings for self and others, while those with a low coefficient of similarity (like Jack) would be expected to have less similar ratings for self and others. For each participant, Tappin and McKay used the coefficient of similarity to compute inferred self-judgments \u2013 how participants should have rated themselves if their ratings were rational. \n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Tappin and McKay not only considered the discrepancy between actual self-ratings and inferred self-ratings; they also considered the extent to which these ratings were differentially affected by trait desirability. Irrational thinking is revealed when trait desirability more accurately predicts actual self-ratings than inferred self-ratings. In other words, you are irrational when you consider a trait highly appealing, and you let that appeal influence your self-ratings in such a way that you distort the similarity between yourself and others.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">Tappin and McKay found that the irrational component of the self-enhancement effect was greater for morality traits than either agency or sociability traits. Participants were least likely to accurately use their self-judgments in projecting other-judgments when considering morality traits, and trait desirability predicted actual self-judgments of morality to a much greater extent than it predicted inferred self-judgments of morality.\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\">...
