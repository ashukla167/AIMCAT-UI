(3) So, where are they and if they exist, why haven\u2019t we seen them yet?, asked the physicist Enrico Fermi in 1950. (4) The mismatch between what we\u2019d expect from the numbers, which is a universe full of spacefaring civilisations, and what we observe \u2013 nothing \u2013 is known as the Fermi Paradox.

This last explanation comes from three Oxford philosophers, whose recently published paper examines the equations that make the Fermi paradox look real. These have to do partly with the number of stars with Earth-like planets in the universe, and, more crucially, with the probabilities of life evolving there, then becoming intelligent, and finally exploring space. None of these are known and we don\u2019t yet know enough to make well-informed guesses. So the numbers that are plugged into all seven terms of the equations that estimate the likelihood of other life in the universe can vary by 12 or more orders of magnitude. The Oxford paper shows that when you take these uncertainties into account and run hundreds of thousands of simulations exploring them, the probability that we are alone in our galaxy, and perhaps in the universe, rises to entirely reasonable levels. ____________________________________________ .\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1913"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu9":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;'><font style='font-family:Arial;'><b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i> <\/i><i>9<\/i><i>:<\/i> Type in your answer in the input box provided below the question.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>As mentioned in the directions to the passage, the sentences in the second paragraph are given in a jumbled order.

The printed items are then cut out and used in various products.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Emerson & Renwick produces special carts which are wheeled into the printing system to configure it for different applications. Some carts contain equipment that accelerates ions from a plasma onto a source material, to spatter molecules from that source onto the web, allowing printing at the atomic scale. Others perform a similar trick using a beam of electrons. Others employ chemically reactive gases to etch features such as holes and channels less than 50 nanometres across into the coatings, for electrical connections. \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">The underlying technologies of the Genesis machine are similar to those found in a conventional graphics press. Careful management of the web through its winding, tension and control is essential. A break in the web, as any newspaperman knows, brings production to a time-consuming and expensive halt and could damage a whole reel.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Printing electronics requires special formulations of ink. Often, these are made with silver which is expensive. An alternative, being worked on by Tawfique Hasan at Cambridge University, is to include flakes of graphene in such inks which reduces the cost drastically. Another idea he is exploring is \u201csmart\u201d wallpaper. In addition to graphene ink, this uses either organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) or quantum dots \u2013 crystals of semiconducting material. These emit light when excited by electricity, so wall coverings printed with such materials could be used to illuminate rooms.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Several groups are working on making thin-film solar panels using printed electronics. A family of crystalline materials called perovskites is attracting interest for roll-to-roll printing. Whereas the best conventionally made silicon-based solar panels convert the energy in sunlight into electricity with an efficiency of 20%, researchers in California, think they can push that to 31% using perovskites. Being small, crystalline grains, perovskites make ideal ingredients of ink.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Inkjet printing is also getting a roll-to-roll makeover, according to David Bird of the Centre for Process Innovation (CPI), Britain. Inkjet printers are not particularly fast, but they are parsimonious, for they spray ink only where it is needed. They are flexible and easily customised. To alter what is being printed requires only a software reload, rather than the changing of a printing plate. And lack of speed is relative. The CPI\u2019s inkjet machine can print copper circuits onto rolls of plastic at a rate of 17 metres a minute. These circuits are used for sensors and radio antennae. Like inkjet printers, 3D printers \u2013 which can also print electronics \u2013 are flexible, but they build things one at a time or in small batches and are mostly used to print larger objects. .... \n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Single-sheet or batch production permits an error to be spotted before it is repeated, but high-speed roll-to-roll systems can churn out a lot of waste if there is any delay in identifying problems. Cameras can be used to detect errors in printed text or graphics, but they are not much help at spotting faults in microscopic layers of transparent material whizzing past on a web. Researchers at CPI have come up with a method that builds a three-dimensional model of the web\u2019s surface using reflected light, and can raise the alarm if it detects depressions that might indicate an uncoated spot.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">At present printed electronic products tend to be used as components rather than complete systems. The technology is a long way from being able to roll-print powerful computer chips, which contain several billion transistors squeezed onto a tiny piece of silicon. These processors are currently made in batches in costly semiconductor fabrication plants.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Using roll-to-roll systems to print lots of transistors in the form of a processor is nevertheless an attractive proposition. Ma Zhenqiang of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and his colleagues recently fabricated a flexible transistor that operates at 110 gigahertz. Dr Ma used an electron beam to etch shapes just ten nanometres wide in a mould that was then employed to form the transistor\u2019s circuitry in an ultra-thin flexible silicon membrane. As the mould can be reused, Dr Ma reckons his method could easily be scaled up for roll-to-roll processing. _______________________________\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1913"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"},"qu17":{"ENGLISH":{"QUESTION_TEXT":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9;\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Which of the following is an application that is least similar to the BCI application used by Mr Kochevar as can be inferred from the passage? <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT1":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Entrepreneurs envisage a world where thought-to-text typing is possible, where people can communicate telepathically, with each other and with machines.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT2":"<p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\">\r\n\t<span><font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Over 300,000 people have cochlear implants, which help them hear by converting sound into electrical signals and sending them into the brain. <\/font> <\/font><\/span><\/p>","OPT3":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>fMRI and PET scanners have now made it possible to understand how our brain functions through images produced by brain scans.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","OPT4":"<span><p style='vertical-align:middle;'> <font style='Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9'><font style='font-family:Arial;'>Futuristic goals include stimulating the visual cortex to help the blind, forging new neural connections in stroke victims and receiving deep-brain stimulation via electrodes to help patients control diseases.\r\n<\/font>\r\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>","CORRECT_ANSWER":"c","UNIT":"","SOLUTION":"-na-","ESSAY_ID":"6038","EASSY_DETAILS":"<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\"> <b>D<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>R<\/b><b>E<\/b><b>C<\/b><b>T<\/b><b>I<\/b><b>O<\/b><b>N<\/b><b>S<\/b><b> <\/b><i>f<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>r<\/i><i> <\/i><i>q<\/i><i>u<\/i><i>e<\/i><i>s<\/i><i>t<\/i><i>i<\/i><i>o<\/i><i>n<\/i><i>s<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>7<\/i><i> <\/i><i>t<\/i><i>o<\/i><i> <\/i><i>1<\/i><i>9<\/i><i>:<\/i> The passage given below is accompanied by a set of three questions.

But Johnson\u2019s fame has never dispelled the idea that the lexicographer is a humdrum, bookish type who reads for precision and who dutifully approves the \u201cright\u201d meanings of \u201cgood\u201d words while preventing \u201cwrong\u201d definitions and \u201cbad\u201d words from entering the dictionary. Lexicographers still struggle, in vain, to dispel this myth about their role. They put the words that people actually use into the dictionary, good ones and bad ones, new ones and old ones.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">In a new book, \u201cWord by Word\u201d, Kory Stamper, a lexicographer for Merriam-Webster, duly carries on the tradition, reminding readers that a lexicographer is a chronicler, not a guardian. She says that a chronicler need not be meek and dispassionate but must list out the rules, many of them hidden and not obvious, of the human language ability. The reader expecting august authority finds it difficult to pinpoint what part of speech a word belongs to. \u201cBut\u201d is usually a conjunction, yet Ms Stamper is not fully sure that it is still one in the sentence \u201cWhat can they do but try?\u201d A colleague proclaims \u201cbut\u201d to be a preposition here. Senior editors sigh, ruling that definitions are more important than grammar in a dictionary, and (rightly) noting that the eight parts of speech into which words are sorted in traditional grammars are not enough for English.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">If lexicography were easy, no one would need a dictionary: meaning and use would be obvious to all. But even after years of reading and defining, the lexicographer finds out how slippery language can be when it comes to pronunciation, grammar and almost every level of language production. It constantly confounds prejudices and refuses to be pinned down. All dictionary-writers can do, in the end, is work hard to describe how a word is used out in the world. If they tried to let their own personal sense of right and wrong come into it, there would be no way of judging between two editors who disagree, or knowing what to do when an old belief runs against the evidence.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Yet judgment has its place. Ms Stamper frequently makes online videos for Merriam-Webster\u2019s \u201cAsk the Editor\u201d series. One of these is about the plural of \u201coctopus\u201d.

In Books VIII and IX of his work the Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle categorizes three different types of friendship: friendships of utility, friendships of pleasure, and friendships of the good (also known as virtuous friendships). Briefly, friendships of utility are where people are on cordial terms primarily because each person benefits from the other in some way. Friendships of pleasure are those where individuals seek out each other\u2019s company because of the joy it brings them. Passionate love affairs and people belonging to the same cultural or social organization fall into this category. Most important of all are friendships of the good. These are friendships based upon mutual respect, admiration for each other\u2019s virtues, and a strong desire to aid and assist the other person because one recognizes an essential goodness in them.

But just why is this so? Because friends are central to Aristotle\u2019s overall conception of what constitutes a good life. In the larger context of the Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle addresses what makes us human. In this book, Aristotle asks the fundamental questions - What does it mean to be a human being and what goals will bring out our best? In this context, Books VIII and IX of the ten-book Nichomachean Ethics are part of his discussion of the nature of eudaimonia, a term often translated as \u2018happiness\u2019 but which literally means [having a] \u2018good soul\u2019.

This leads us directly to the category of social relations Aristotle calls philia, which is the \u2018friendship of the good\u2019. For Aristotle, the best way of defining philia (what we might these days call \u2018close friends\u2019) is \u2018those who hold what they have in common\u2019. Essentially, philia is a personal bond you have with another being which is freely chosen because of the virtues you see in your friend. Polis is the ancient Greek term for city, but it literally means \u2018a body of citizens\u2019, and it relates to the fact that most of us live not just within a family structure but rather within a larger political system. Yet most of the people in such a system are strangers to each other. If they were all related, it would be clearer what roles each person is to play (for instance, when a monarch has children, usually the firstborn is deemed to be the next in line to rule); but in most political systems there is more flexibility, and more opportunity for people to develop their talents in different ways.

Some utopian thinkers, such as the followers of the later Greek philosopher Epicurus, took this to mean that we should attempt to live only among friends.

Friendships of pleasure are those where individuals seek out each other\u2019s company because of the joy it brings them.

In the larger context of the Nichomachean Ethics, Aristotle addresses what makes us human. In this book, Aristotle asks the fundamental questions - What does it mean to be a human being and what goals will bring out our best? In this context, Books VIII and IX of the ten-book Nichomachean Ethics are part of his discussion of the nature of eudaimonia, a term often translated as \u2018happiness\u2019 but which literally means [having a] \u2018good soul\u2019.

Good friends become useful in this sort of political situation.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n<span><p style=\"vertical-align:middle;\"> <font style=\"Color:black;font-family:Arial;size:9\"><font style=\"font-family:Arial;\">Aristotle points out that if in fact all people in a given society were friends, there would be no need for laws, since we would naturally work out our differences: \u201cWhen people are friends,\u201d he writes, \u201cthey have no need of justice, but when they are just, they need friendship in addition\u201d. Some utopian thinkers, such as the followers of the later Greek philosopher Epicurus, took this to mean that we should attempt to live only among friends. But Aristotle is quite clear that this is not possible, for the basic reason that friendship requires commitment of time and a trusting relationship, and there are natural limits to how many such connections we can make.\n<\/font>\n<\/font><\/p><\/span>\n","ESSAY_NAME":"D-X) Test name AIMCAT1913"},"HINDI":{"QUESTION_TEXT":" ","CORRECT_ANSWER":" ","UNIT":" ","SOLUTION":"","ESSAY_ID":"0","EASSY_DETAILS":"","ESSAY_NAME":""},"SUBJECT_ID":"1","TOPIC_ID":" 167","QUESTION_TYPE":"7","RIGHT_MARKS":"3","WRONG_MARKS":"1","TIME":"0"}}
